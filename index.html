<p>Last week, I published <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2022/08/09/this-post-on.html">a micro post</a> about my thoughts after reading Matt Birchler admonish his readers against switching blogging platforms. Birchler&rsquo;s main point was that switching platforms made it harder on readers and, therefore, more difficult to retain consistent readership. It&rsquo;s a solid point and one that really resonated with me. I have a tendency to tinker with different tools, some of which are blogging engines. That means I sometimes use different services to publish my posts.</p>
<p>For a while, I&rsquo;ve realized moving between domains or services can be confusing for my readers, but I haven&rsquo;t been able to settle on one platform (although I definitely use Micro.blog the most). I&rsquo;ve used alternate domains and subdomains to experiment with a variety of different tools.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder than ever to decide on a blogging service because being able to post in a chronological order on a well-designed, easy-to-read site is no longer the only criteria with which to evaluate the service. The situation has been complicated by the arrival of newsletters. While newsletters and blogs used to sit separately, they have now merged in a way that makes sense. As I detailed in <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2022/03/30/writing-for-an.html">this post about writing online</a>, readers now want to be able to receive your writing in different mediums. One of those primary mediums is through email. The others are RSS, the web and social media. It&rsquo;s now an expectation that your work be accessible through all of those channels. Among those delivery mechanisms, Birchler&rsquo;s post seems to only consider the web and RSS. His point is mainly that you should never change your URL or your RSS feed, if you can avoid it. As he says, your readers couldn&rsquo;t care less what service you&rsquo;re using, as long as the experience doesn&rsquo;t change substantially for them.</p>
<h2 id="an-email-list">An email list</h2>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve acknowledged that Birchler&rsquo;s post made a good point and caused me to think, let me play a bit of devil&rsquo;s advocate. When you factor in newsletters, you introduce a delivery mechanism where, theoretically, the service you are using matters even less. In contrast to the web and RSS, where your reader is fetching from your site, with email and newsletters, you are pushing your output to them. This puts less of a strain on your readers to follow you wherever you go. Instead of them having to take action to go <em>with you</em>, they just need to <em>be there</em> for the journey. It takes the burden off the reader and puts it on you to migrate their email addresses to your new location. You&rsquo;re doing all the heavy lifting. The reader may see a different UI, but they should be set up to receive the new content, from wherever it may come.</p>
<p>When I first set up the current iteration of my newsletter, I read <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2022/01/19/im-following-austin.html">this post from Austin Kleon</a> about why you should have an email list of your followers. I gained a few followers just by posting about it. That list is with me, regardless of what service I choose to use, as long as I can import email addresses, like most services allow (ahem, Micro.blog). Since the readers have entrusted me with their email address, if I switch services, the most they will have to do is click on an email that gets autogenerated to consent to be part of a different newsletter provider. If your newsletters include pointers to your blog posts, your readers will have easy access to those posts.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-stay-or-should-i-go">Should I stay or should I go?</h2>
<p>Even as I think about the difficulty in getting readers to follow you and then make a change, I realize that there are ways to make it easier on that group of people. It&rsquo;s possible now to put the hard work in the writer&rsquo;s corner, and leave the decision about return on investment up to them. It&rsquo;s empowering, but it takes an explicit call to your followers to trust you enough to share their email and allow you access to their inbox. Hopefully, you have earned that trust through your writing. If so, you should be able to carry your readers along for the ride.</p>

			 <p>LEGO <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/sustainability/environment/replay">has an initiative</a> to help with environmental sustainability in the form of reuse of their bricks. Their Replay program encourages you to donate the no-longer-used bricks to children in need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LEGO Replay is a simple-to-use platform that allows you to pass forward your much-loved LEGO bricks and share the power of play with kids in need. When children play with your donated LEGO bricks, it helps them learn to problem solve, collaborate, and think creatively. With LEGO Replay, worlds of play can be rebuilt and reimagined many times over helping to inspire the builders of tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You simply print out a packing label and ship the bricks.</p>
<p>The program seems like a great idea, as LEGO bricks tend to hold up well over time. Some of our collection is from when my brother and I were kids. Sadly, neither of my boys still play with their LEGO sets, so I am tempted to encourage the donation of these toys to those who might appreciate and use them.</p>

<p>One of the co-creators of the latest official D&amp;D adventure, <em>Journeys Through the Radiant Citadel</em>, Ajit George, <a href="https://youtu.be/5IC0AbjlIJM">compares the setting of the book</a> to solarpunk. I wrote about solarpunk in <a href="https://frostedechoes.net/newsletter/issue-no-8/">issue no. 8 of the newsletter</a>. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk">defines it this way</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Solarpunk is a genre and art movement that envisions how the future might look if humanity succeeded in solving major contemporary challenges with an emphasis on sustainability, climate change and pollution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In D&amp;D, of course, we are not dealing with climate change or sustainability (typically), but there is a sort of bright, organic aesthetic that comes along with solarpunk. It has kind of the opposite energy of grimdark. A definition of grimdark (again, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimdark">Wikipedia</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grimdark is a subgenre of speculative fiction with a tone, style, or setting that is particularly dystopian, amoral, and violent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your experience with tabletop role-playing games and specifically Dungeon &amp; Dragons or Warhammer 40,000 goes back a ways, you will remember when grimdark was the main, if not only, aesthetic involved with those types of games. The introduction of a more positive vibe in <em>Journeys Through the Radiant Citadel</em> is a nice change. I can still remember when D&amp;D adventures were hack n' slash dungeon crawlers. More of an emphasis on cooperation and thoughtful strategy still takes adjustment, but is welcome.</p>
<p>Another focus of this adventure module that breaks from tradition is the emphasis on multiculturalism. In addition to the inclusion of typical fantasy character races such as dwarves and elves, the human population is made up of different ethnicities. Some of those ethnicities bear resemblance to those in our world that have traditionally been underrepresented in fantasy worlds. The module brings their traditions into the D&amp;D world. It&rsquo;s refreshing to see this representation in the playgrounds of our imagination.</p>

<p><em>Journeys Through the Radiant Citadel</em> is out now and should be available at your favorite game store.</p>

<p>The biggest irony of the last couple of weeks has to be Rep. Peter Meijer’s loss in the Western Michigan Republican primary. As recently as the beginning of this year, The Atlantic did an in-depth profile on Meijer and how he was at odds with his own party of the impeachment of Donald Trump and other issues related to the former president.</p>
<p>The piece, by Tim Alberta, is entitled <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/peter-meijer-freshman-republican-impeach/620844/">What the GOP Does to Its Own Dissenters</a>. The profile centered around the premise that in opposing the former president, Meijer had put himself in the crosshairs of his own party.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At one point, Meijer described to me the psychological forces at work in his party, the reasons so many Republicans have refused to confront the tragedy of January 6 and the nature of the ongoing threat. Some people are motivated by raw power, he said. Others have acted out of partisan spite, or ignorance, or warped perceptions of truth and lies. But the chief explanation, he said, is fear. People are afraid for their safety. They are afraid for their careers. Above all, they are afraid of fighting a losing battle in an empty foxhole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meijer described a group of colleagues too afraid to do what they knew was right and stand with him.</p>
<p>The irony came in the fact that ultimately, Meijer was not driven to defeat by his own party, as Alberta had strongly hinted that he might be in his profile. Meijer was defeated in his primary because the Democrats pumped a half a million dollars into the campaign of Meijer&rsquo;s opponent, John Gibbs, a Republican with a Trump endorsement. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has begun a pattern of supporting candidates who are most closely aligned with the twice-impeached former president by providing significant monetary support, reasoning that they will be easier to defeat in the general elections that follow their primaries.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an extremely cynical and disruptive play by the DCCC and, unsurprisingly, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3586542-meijer-loss-sparks-new-criticism-of-democratic-meddling-in-gop-primaries/">it has brought criticism</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), who also voted to impeach Trump last year and is not seeking reelection, said that Democrats “own” Meijer’s loss, blaming them for compromising their own values by propping up the campaign of a candidate who has echoed Trump’s false claim that the 2020 election was stolen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Here’s the thing: don’t keep coming to me asking where are all the good Republicans that defend democracy and then take your donors’ money and spend half-a-million dollars promoting one of the worst election deniers that’s out there,” Kinzinger said on CNN. “The DCCC needs to be ashamed of themselves.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The DCCC pouring funds into candidates who stand for everything they claim to be against is not only a dishonest strategy, it&rsquo;s a risky one. If the candidate that they support wins in the general election, they will have gambled away their money (presumably from donors to the party) and be put in the situation of having to fend off another election denier who is fighting against the democratic process. It imperils not only their chances of passing legislation that the Democratic base would like to see, but also the workings of elections that safeguard our republic.</p>
<p>Given this strategy, it would be perhaps fitting if the new Democratic slogan became, &ldquo;Democrats: We may not be as treacherous as Republicans, but we&rsquo;re getting there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Noah Millman writes about how little reality there is in film and TV these days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But go back and watch Spielberg films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T.—the reality of those worlds is very richly textured and fully realized. The uncanny in those movies intrudes on a reality that still feels fully real. That’s not just a matter of getting individual details right, though. The popular series Stranger Things is meticulous about getting details right, but it’s a Frankenstein world, built of spare parts from earlier movies; there is nothing genuinely real or living about it. Indeed, the entire premise of the series (a premise that has paid off handsomely) is that audiences would love to participate in a festival of pure nostalgia that isn’t at all about life, but entirely about how life was represented. The fantasy being sold is less of living in the 1980s than of watching 1980s-era movies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I strongly agree with his assessment of <em>Stranger Things</em>, but I&rsquo;m uncertain if that&rsquo;s a bad thing. Occasionally, I want to look at the decade in which I grew up through rose-colored glasses. If I wanted a straight retelling, I would check out a historical drama or a documentary. There are definitely occasions when I crave an idealized view of the past, especially when it comes to my childhood. In those instances, the meta construction of watching a contemporary project built to seem like a 80s era movie suits just fine.</p>

<p>Bandcamp has <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/marci-marci-review">a review of the debut album</a> by Marci, AKA Marta Cikojevic, who plays keyboards in the band TOPS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The album summons the spirit of the ‘80s, at various points recalling Tears for Fears, Sade, and Pretenders with its dreamy vocals and fuzzy synth lines. But Marci remains distinctly contemporary, and slots nearly alongside similar albums by artists like Caroline Rose or Shura: distinctly danceable, quietly emotional, and wrapped up in jubilant confidence. A triumphant debut, Marci takes hold of the senses, summoning the slick rub of skin on a dark dance floor, the tingle of ocean salt spray, or the laughter of your closest friends coming from the next room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote about the song &ldquo;Terminal,&rdquo; a disco-inflected jam by Marci <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2022/06/10/terminal.html">a couple of months ago</a>. Now that I&rsquo;ve heard the whole full length (a few times now, if that tells you anything), I can see influences from the early 80&rsquo;s as well as the heyday of disco. Both &ldquo;Immaterial Girl&rdquo; and &ldquo;BB I Would Die&rdquo; bring to mind early solo Michael Jackson. The latter has a &ldquo;The Girl Is Mine&rdquo; vibe — until it comes to the chorus — that makes you wonder if Paul McCartney is going to come in with vocals at some point. Cikojevic&rsquo;s voice on &ldquo;Call Of The Wild&rdquo; brings to mind Caroline Polachek. Influences show up all over this record, but it&rsquo;s also got a distinctiveness to it. I&rsquo;m glad to hear Cikojevic step out from behind the keyboards and project her own persona.</p>

			 <p>In his latest newsletter, Charlie Warzel dives into DALL-E and profiles Andy Baio&rsquo;s experiments with the tool. Baio has found it rewarding to stretch DALL-E to its limits (call it boundary testing, if you like).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The engine doesn’t generate text well at all—it can generally only create short words. It’s bad at creating faces, and most trademarked material and images of famous people are blocked so that people don’t abuse the software. But Baio has also found more interesting limitations. “Anything that’s an opposite, like a horse riding a man or a hand with six fingers, is a real struggle for it,” he said. “We want to think that DALL-E has this wild imagination and that it is capable of generating wildly unusual images, but because it’s been trained on tens of thousands of images of people with 10 fingers, it really struggles.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rumor has it that DALL-E will be opening to a broader beta cohort in the upcoming weeks. I&rsquo;d like to play around with it, but I expect my images will be fairly pedestrian. I&rsquo;m not into surrealism like the image generator&rsquo;s namesake.</p>

<p><img src="https://frostedechoes.com/uploads/2022/486ce74336.png" alt=""></p>
<p>While it may not make writing about these shows as interesting, I have had a lot of fun watching all the Star Wars entries into episodic television. In fact, sometimes I can&rsquo;t understand the depths that people go to in their dissection of these series. I grew up on shows like <em>Knight Rider</em>, <em>Wonder Woman</em>, <em>The Dukes of Hazzard</em>, <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, etc. Has anyone watched these shows recently and done a comparison to what we have available now? The difference is <em>stark</em>. On <em>Buck Rogers</em>, the droid would waddle around saying, &ldquo;beedee beedee beedee.&rdquo; That was supposed to transport us to this future of robots and interplanetary travel we could all hardly imagine. It isn&rsquo;t just the special effects, either. The storylines and level of drama on these new shows are light years ahead of what we watched back then on TV. Shows on streaming services have a cinematic quality bar they jump over that we never would have dreamed of shows hurdling in those days.</p>
<p>Into this discussion comes the trailer for the soon-to-be-released Star Wars series, <em>Andor</em>. Given how much I liked <em>Rogue One</em>, I&rsquo;ve been very eager to see this show about its protagonist come to fruition. The preview to which we have been treated looks astonishing. Action, intrigue, moral considerations, transcendent worldbuilding: it seems to check all of these boxes and more.</p>

<p>Clive Thompson writes about rewilding cities, in a new extension of his &ldquo;rewilding your attention&rdquo; concept. In the piece, he profiles cities that have ripped up roads made for cars in favor of rivers and public spaces. He compares the way cities have been built around the automobile to monocropping.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, one thing we learned from the 20th century is that monocropping is freaking dangerous. Whenever we ploughed over fields and regions to plant a single crop, the land got weaker over time, because it lost that dense, gnarly, diverse spectrum of life. Farmers for centuries knew this, which is why they rotated crops and had a network of animal life interpenetrating small farms. But with big industrial farming, we monocropped, and created — decades down the line — crappier soil, entire regions susceptible to a single pest, and unexpected knock-on effects. (Like how industrial farming destroyed roadside milkweed, helping to decimate Monarch butterfly populations.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting concept that begs the questions of whether the cities that have &ldquo;rewilded,&rdquo; to some extent, are healthier for their inhabitants and in what ways that could be measured.</p>
<p>In his book <em>The Life We&rsquo;re Looking For</em>, Andy Crouch examines how we are increasingly building our environments around machines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The great urbanist Jane Jacobs masterfully outlined, in her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities, the elements of an urban environment that make it a healthy place for human habitation: mixed-use buildings, plenty of chances for street-level interaction, limited traffic, priority for pedestrians. It is not much exaggeration to say that these are precisely the conditions that are worst for autonomous vehicles. The closer an environment is to being genuinely good for human beings, the worse it is for a self-driving car.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He writes of humans creating &ldquo;attenuated cultural environments that treat persons like machines.&rdquo; The effort to rewild cities is a pushback against this trend, and maybe even a necessary one if people are to flourish.</p>

<p>I consider myself fortunate to have procured a subscription to the <a href="https://feedbin.com">feed reader platform Feedbin</a>, when it first launched, after the untimely demise of Google Reader. Getting in early allowed me to lock into the service at $2 a month. Feedbin has been improving over the years, adding features that make it more of a one-stop-shop for keeping up with the things you follow on the internet. Many times, I even view most of my Twitter feed using the app because I would rather not venture into the stream.</p>
<p>One of the uses I&rsquo;ve had for Feedbin has been listening to podcasts, for which the web app has a nice built-in player. It reminds me of the old days, when Mac feed readers like Newsfire had podcast features. After all, podcasts are just RSS enclosures, so they make sense in your favorite feed reading software. However, that doesn&rsquo;t help much when you want to take your podcasts on the road. Enter <a href="https://feedbin.com/airshow">Airshow</a>. The new podcast app from Feedbin syncs with your podcast subscriptions and has just enough functionality to be a delight. It&rsquo;s a breath of fresh air (no pun intended) after using some other, ahem, &ldquo;official&rdquo; podcast apps.</p>
<p><img src="https://frostedechoes.com/uploads/2022/e838563f98.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Airshow mainly relies on a queue for management. You download new episodes, and they get added to your queue. <em>Simple</em>. However, I think my favorite thing about the app, and the differentiator, is that you can add shows either as subscriptions or bookmarks. Subscriptions are shows that you want automatically downloaded when new episodes arrive. Bookmarks are shows that you check out occasionally, and may not choose to download every episode. Other podcast apps allow you to make similar choice, but none present the binary so elegantly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found Airshow to have much more reliable synchronization than Apple&rsquo;s Podcast app. In fact, you can watch the timeline scrubber synchronize in real-time. Airshow was built to &ldquo;add value to your Feedbin subscription&rdquo; and it does exactly that.</p>

<p>Jack King examines the implications of creators editing shows after they have been released. He cites the case of the Duffer bros. making a recent change to an episode of Stranger Things Season 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A show like <em>Stranger Things</em>, the most highly watched series on <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/gallery/best-netflix-series-uk">Netflix</a> in the English language, boasts huge cultural cachet: if the Duffers are doing it, who&rsquo;s to say that other creators won&rsquo;t? One day patches might become as commonplace in screen media as they are in video games, and that is a truly worrying precedent for consumers and the integrity of art alike.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to compare TV shows to video games, regarding the ability to make corrections after a release. Once the trend started with video games, it spread until the quality of the initial game was not as important, as the makers knew they could put out a patch after the release. Patching video games is a bit different from changing content in a TV show, though. With the show, you are dealing more with actors, crews, writers and availability, instead just diverting developers who are already working on the next project. You can see some parallels, but ultimately, I think it&rsquo;s a pretty different paradigm.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/07/2024-democratic-presidential-candidates-whitmer-warnock-biden.html">A recent piece</a>, by Ben Mathis-Lilley, in Slate Magazine, shows what kind of perspective you develop when you are as deep into identity politics as Slate. The piece focuses on the people who might get a Democratic presidential nomination. Mathis-Lilley does a brief writeup on NC Governor Roy Cooper’s chances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought I was getting pranked when Roy Cooper appeared on screen. This is what he looks like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://frostedechoes.com/uploads/2022/9258d4ac5b.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not a rising-star modern politician. This is the leader of an evangelical congregation in 1966. This is a guy who thinks Jimmy Carter is “too rock ’n’ roll.” This is what it would look like if a sweater designed a human. This is an advertisement you use to scare teenagers into using drugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not that Cooper was incoherent in his statements about subjects such as raising teacher pay and using “science and data” to “make the tough decisions” about COVID. He would probably win some votes from older Americans who aren’t paying close attention and who might get him kind of conflated in their head with Ronald Reagan. But no. It’s not going to happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have a candidate being judged solely on their looks in an evaluation that this person presents like an older white dude who is pretty buttoned down. You don’t get an analysis of politics — or you would see that Roy Cooper is pretty progressive. Nor do you get the opinions of the voters in the candidate’s state, because Cooper would certainly shine in that area. I’ve had a chance to interact with Gov. Cooper, and he’s a very competent thinker and leader.</p>
<p>If you are considering a candidate’s viability based on their looks or the identity box you put them in, you’re not only a bad political strategist, you’re also probably a poor voter.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/prairie-madness-study-silence-great-plains">piece from Atlas Obscura by James Gaines</a>, about something called &ldquo;prairie madness,&rdquo; that afflicted settlers in the plains of areas like Nebraska piqued my interest. At the time of the phenomenon, people who settled in the plains were thought to have been suffering from the effects of isolation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both fictional and historical accounts of this time and place often blame “prairie madness” on the isolation and bleak conditions the settlers encountered. But many also mention something unexpected: the sounds of the prairie. Smalley wrote that during winter “the silence of death rests on the vast landscape.” And a character in Manitoba settler Nellie McClung’s story “The Neutral Fuse” writes a poem about the droning soundtrack of the plains, “I hate the wind with its evil spite, and it hates me with a hate as deep, and hisses and jeers when I try to sleep.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s only recently that investigators have begun speculating that a combination of certain sounds (and lack thereof) could have been causing the symptoms settlers were experiencing.</p>

<p>The first thing that hits you from Swiss outfit The Churchhill Garden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Always There&rdquo; are the reverb(y) guitars. Before too long, though, you find yourself entranced by the saccharine sweetness of American lead singer Krissy Vanderwoude&rsquo;s vocals, which bring to mind Velocity Girl&rsquo;s Sarah Shannon. As Vanderwoude sings about &ldquo;kindness, patience and grace,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s marvelous to get a little twee go along with the richness of her honeyed tone.</p>
<p>I liked last year&rsquo;s single, &ldquo;Grounded&rdquo; by the band, but there&rsquo;s nothing of the bite from that song here. I could easily imagine &ldquo;Always There&rdquo; as a feature track on a 1992 episode of 120 Minutes and Churchhill Garden perhaps opening for peak-of-their-powers era Lush. Now, they just have to put out a full-length!</p>
<hr>
<p>As a bonus, here is The Churchhill Garden&rsquo;s cover of The Cure track &ldquo;Halo,&rdquo; from the b-side of the &ldquo;Friday I&rsquo;m In Love&rdquo; single, where they riff on &ldquo;Pictures Of You&rdquo; at the end. The collected b-sides from the <em>Wish</em> album is one of my favorite groups of songs, so this is such a treat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In recent days I have been contacted by many concerned citizens about my social media silence in the face of the Recent News. Several of you have graciously reminded me that silence is violence, which rhymes, and that is very helpful.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I first off wanted to apologize. There is no excuse for my silence. I should always be available to speak up on social media when such important issues arise. And my failure to speak is tantamount to treason or heresy or bigotry or bigamy. Maybe all of the above. You decide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then goes on to list all of the (very real) reasons he might not have said something about topic (x) on Twitter.</p>
<p>One of my biggest frustrations is the tendency of the extremely online to expect people to react to everything <em>they</em> consider problematic. It&rsquo;s slacktavism by fiat. It does little to nothing to make the world a better place and mainly just contributes to the denigration of online conversation (there, I rhymed).</p>

<p><strong>Welp, I&rsquo;m doing it.</strong> I&rsquo;m becoming one of those mechanical keyboard nerds. It wasn&rsquo;t intentional, mind you, but out of necessity. My Apple &ldquo;magic&rdquo; bluetooth keyboard and mouse won&rsquo;t easily switch between one Mac and another. Due to my work-from-home setup having a personal Mac and a work Mac, I have spent literally hours of time frustratingly trying to get my peripherals to pair with one device or another. I got locked out of my personal Mac Mini, at one point, because the computer would not recognize the bluetooth devices. I had to dig in my closet for an old wired keyboard and mouse. If I hadn&rsquo;t had those stashed away, I&rsquo;m not sure what I would have done.</p>
<p>As I shopped for bluetooth peripherals that could switch between one device and another, I came upon the much-beloved Keychron mechanical keyboard. I had read about these devices before and not paid much attention, because I like the Apple low-travel keyboards. Knowing that I simply had to replace my keyboard, though, pushed me into checking out the Keychrons. I was further inspired by <a href="https://www.makerstations.io/work-from-home-essentials/">this post</a> from Maker Stations, detailing what parts of their work-from-home setups people appreciated the most. Unsurprisingly, given their rabid fanbase, many people picked their mechanical keyboards.</p>
<p>Blogger Matt Birchler has been chronicling his descent into the world of mechanical keyboard obsessives, with posts like <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/my-dumb-hobby/">this one</a>. He discusses how he replaced the switches, the keys, and the foam, as well as adding tape, to get things just right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In another month or two I&rsquo;ll think of something else I can do to it, and it will just keep improving. This keyboard has cost me far more than anyone needs to spend on a keyboard, but that&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s a hobby! Some people fix up cars when they could just buy a Camry, and other people fiddle with keyboards when they could just use a $20 from Dell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It reminds me of discussing my reading to blogging workflow with my boss. When I explained it to him, in all of its complexity, he was laughing at me. <em>This is my hobby</em>, I told him. Some people play golf. I read and blog about things. So, it makes sense that I would tinker. When looking at the cost/benefit of automating something, you typically total up how many times you expect to perform a certain action. That tells you whether the time and effort spent automating will be paid back (whether you will get your return on investment). If you will be performing an action over and over again, it&rsquo;s best to invest in automating that action.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2022/ac41aece01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Sure, my hobbies are nerdy things. You know what, though, my wife (who&rsquo;s good opinion I desire above all others), likes it that way. As we watched a motorcycle rev up and speed out of sight tonight, she expressed her relief that I would never decide to get a motorcycle. I told her that was probably true, but that I&rsquo;m becoming a mechanical keyboard guy. She informed me that she was fine with me buying as many keyboards as I want. At least, she reasons, this hobby is not dangerous.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/alvvays-pharmacist/">Pitchfork reviews the new Alvvays track</a>, &ldquo;Pharmacist,&rdquo; which is their first in 5 years. The band sounds like they&rsquo;ve developed a fascination with shoegaze, with enough glide guitar to make Kevin Shields jealous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Pharmacist” is overblown in all the right ways, with all the meticulously layered noise growing into a thicket around Rankin’s tender nostalgia. “It’s alright, I know I never crossed your mind,” she concludes. After this brutally honest admission, Alvvays burn through the end of “Pharmacist” with a flurry of distortion, sonic immolation at its finest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last 30 seconds of the track showcase a squealing guitar solo that rides atop the noise and then breaks down, Sonic Youth style. The burn down is satisfying in its totality. The video is more of a showcase for the audio than a proper video, but after half a decade of absence, I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>

<p>The church that I have been attending, <a href="https://www.allsaintsnc.org/">All Saints Orthodox Church</a>, has a new website design and a video to go along with it. The video is a meditation on what worship is like for an Orthodox Christian, focusing on the five senses. I appreciate the fact that it brings up the conditioning of the smells, sounds and sights that are involved with worship. I have come to associate the incense used at Divine Liturgy with the very act of worship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>May my prayer be set before you like incense; may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice. (Psalm 141:2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, that the soundtrack is a an ambient track in the vein of Hammock endears me all the more to this depiction of worship in an ancient tradition.</p>

<p>The concept of the Finest Hour playlist is to distill a favorite band&rsquo;s discography into an hour of music (or as close to an hour as reasonably possible). It&rsquo;s a bit of a challenge trying to do a &ldquo;greatest hits&rdquo; style playlist within the time constraints and with the right sequencing. The idea was taken from <a href="https://zioibi.com">Adam Wood</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Swedish indie band The Radio Dept. has always been mysterious and mercurial. You can compare their early days to early period Belle and Sebastian, when little was known about the bands, and they wanted it that way.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The Radio Dept. are at once sometimes poppy with a trace of twee (see &ldquo;Bachelor Kisses&rdquo;) and also intensely political (see &ldquo;Death to Fascism,&rdquo; &ldquo;Swedish Guns&rdquo;). They are known for fights with their record label.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I had the rare opportunity to see the Radio Dept. play a few years ago, and it was one of the most memorable shows I&rsquo;ve been to — though that may have to do with the recency effect and my aging brain. One thing that stuck out to me was how they almost sounded industrial when playing the political songs listed above. It gave me a new conception of the band and made me wish they would explore that territory a bit more.</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;ve given you some good tracks here with which to explore one of the most influential bands in Swedish indie pop. Enjoy!</p>

			 <p>Matt Birchler speculates about why Netflix chose not to release Stranger Things Season 4 all at once.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any data to back this up, but I wonder if the release schedule for shows is what makes the difference for first month unsubscribers being higher on Netflix. If you want to keep up with The Mandalorian on Disney+, you gotta subscribe for at least 2 months to watch it as the rest of the world does. Same deal with most things on Apple TV+, Hulu, and HBO Max as well. But Netflix still releases basically all of their shows at once, so you can binge them in a week and cancel without missing the zeitgeist. As a viewer, I&rsquo;ve actually come back to preferring the weekly release cycle as well. It&rsquo;s just more fun to enjoy a show for a couple moths with people all at the same place rather than to have a few days where you feel you need to watch to avoid spoilers or miss the conversations people have about the show.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Birchler, I prefer the weekly release cycle. I never enjoyed binging a show, though, which occasionally drove my wife nuts. The weekly cadence makes a show feel more like an event or a special occasion. I have to say it was great to have my whole family look forward to the nights we could watch Obi-Wan Kenobi together. With my sons' knowledge of Star Wars lore, we had some pretty interesting discussions during and after the episodes. I don&rsquo;t think the same dynamic would have taken hold with a binge.</p>
<p>I also wonder why it has taken so long for Netflix to adopt the strategy of the other streaming services. Despite what they&rsquo;ve said in the past, the objective is not to get you to stream a ton of content, but to stream enough content that you really like, so you&rsquo;ll maintain that subscription every month. The more you stream, the more they have to rely on AWS elasticity and scale out, costing them more. So it makes sense to have less frequently released, higher quality content.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://quiteokgames.com/">Laysara: Summit Kingdom</a> is an upcoming strategy game by Quite OK Games that has you building and sustaining a kingdom on the side of a mountain.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2022/b271819d20.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t play many video games these days, but when I do, it&rsquo;s usually because the game presents a world that I want to inhabit. A place that has intrigue or beauty. Managing a mountainside kingdom like a Tibetan Prince has enormous appeal to me. I could practically spend all day just looking at screenshots of these carefully built civilizations from a birds-eye view. The fact that the game isn&rsquo;t concerned about defeating invading armies or invading other kingdoms is a plus for me. I can&rsquo;t forget those blood curdling screams the orcs would make in Warcraft when they were coming to trash the buildings you had created. Laysara focuses mainly on staving off or surviving natural disasters (like avalanches — this is set on a mountain, after all) and kingdom management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Establishing a flourishing city in harsh upland conditions is not an easy feat. Adjust your build strategy to gameplay-affecting vegetation zones and expand to more distant mountain slopes to reach scarce resources. Carefully plan production chains and satisfy various needs of your three-caste society while dealing with mountain hazards such as weather breakdowns and avalanches!</p>

<p>If only I had a Windows machine so I could play this!</p>

<p>In <a href="https://world.hey.com/adamwood/tendrils-007-self-promo-bouquet-e1a95972">a recent newsletter</a>, Adam Wood proposed something called &ldquo;Finest Hour.&rdquo; The project was to create an hour-long playlist from a favorite artist. He placed special emphasis on the process of track selection and sequencing. I was intrigued by the idea. This exercise might have been more fun in the days of cassette tapes, when you truly would be limited by the constraints of the physical medium itself. The project would take a lot longer, but the challenge itself would be more rewarding.</p>
<p>Here we are, though, firmly entrenched in the digital age, and there is joy even in the ease of assembling such a precise collection. The band I chose for the project is one that has stuck with me since my youth. Truth be told, unlike many who tend to keep rotating music they listened to in high school or college (which makes me think of the titular character of <em>Billy Madison</em>), I find myself exploring new music a lot more often. But Polvo has had staying power. I think it&rsquo;s the complexity of their angular and winding tunes, which typically have interesting and hard-to-describe pop hooks. Never anything but inventive, Polvo loomed large in the local music scene when I was growing up and made for a perfect first show at a rock club.</p>
<p>Polvo confounded some who couldn&rsquo;t do the math. The author of the review of their discography in The_ Trouser Press Guide to &rsquo;90s Indie Rock_ wrote, &ldquo;…it&rsquo;s hard not to ruminate about what the band might be capable of if someone made them walk a straight line just once.&rdquo; Those who got them really got them, though. I count myself among that &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; group.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<hr>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never heard Polvo before, take a listen and see what you think. Keep in mind that they can be challenging, but stick with them. There are really no other bands that sound like this one. If you have heard them before, feel free to critique the tracks I chose to include.</p>

<p>I wrote about the sci-fi successor to the fantasy tabletop RPG <em>Ironsworn</em> in the <a href="https://frostedechoes.net/newsletter/issue-no-8/">Week on the Web newsletter</a> a few months ago. <a href="https://www.ironswornrpg.com/product-ironsworn-starforged"><em>Starforged</em></a> has now been officially releases in digital form, with pre-orders for the hard copy being taken as well. The worldbuilding for this game looks fantastic, and its influences are an enticing mix of sci-fi fantasy universes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inspiration comes from the quest-driven stories of The Mandalorian, the lived-in aesthetic and fantasy-infused trappings of the original Star Wars trilogy, the workaday exploits of Firefly, the isolated horror of Alien, the mysticism and faction politics of Dune, the retro-tech and desperation of Battlestar Galactica&rsquo;s modern reboot, the cosmic mysteries and class struggles of The Expanse, and the gonzo adventures and fantastic locations of Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gaming engine is based on <em>Ironsworn</em>, which took elements from the <em>Apocalypse World</em> rules. I used to play a bit of <em>Dungeon World</em> (based on <em>Apocalypse World</em>) and really appreciated the story-driven mechanics. The rules are lightweight and flexible and designed to drive the fiction. You don&rsquo;t get bogged down into detail about how something is going to work. The rules are easy enough to let the play and the story flow.</p>
<p>One of the more unique aspects of <em>Starforged</em> is the different modes of play:</p>
<ol>
<li>Guided: One or more players take the role of their characters, while a guide moderates the session.</li>
<li>Co-Op: You and one or more friends play together to overcome challenges and complete quests. A guide is not required.</li>
<li>Solo: You portray a lone character driven to fulfill vows in a dangerous world.</li>
</ol>
<p>The variety of game modes and the fact that you can play with fewer people ratchets up the value of this game. Did I mention the PDF is only <strong>$20</strong> and the full color hardback 404-page book + immediate download of the PDF is only <strong>$40</strong>? Honestly, the purchase would be worth the illustrations and intriguing settings alone. Gorgeous artwork by <a href="https://twitter.com/joshmeehanart?s=21&amp;t=apIUttto-oB0YUctWU8VIQ">Joshua Meehan</a> gives the player an immersive sense of the world which they will be exploring. It is gritty and innovative and ready to be expanded by the player&rsquo;s imagination. It certainly shows the direction of the game has been shaped by some of the recent Star Wars TV series we&rsquo;ve been enjoying.</p>
<p>My oldest is off school for the summer and is trying to learn the arcane rules of the <em>Star Wars: Force and Destiny</em> RPG, so we&rsquo;ve got a bit of competition. Although I&rsquo;m happy he is finally picking up the book we got him for Christmas, and it&rsquo;s getting used, I&rsquo;m a little concerned that the complexity of the rule set for that game will keep it from being — you know — fun. I have much more confidence in the variant of the <em>Apocolypse World</em> engine that <em>Starforged</em> is using to provide a good basis for fun and engrossing gameplay. Maybe we can each learn the systems for our respective games and do a little comparison testing. I can think of worse ways to spend a few summer days.</p>

			 <p>Grace Ives' new album, <em>Janky Star</em>, caught me a bit by surprise. I became immediately attached to the title of the album and recognized it&rsquo;s almost complete disregard for musical conventions. It&rsquo;s difficult to put this one neatly into a musical genre. It bounces a bit all over the place and practically dares you to try to classify it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/grace-ives-janky-star/">Pitchfork review of the album</a>, by Arielle Gordon, brings up the co-producer Justin Raisen, as partially responsible for the held together by duct-tape sound.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Justin Raisen, Janky Star’s co-producer, provides a richer backdrop for her flexible vocals, pushing beyond her Roland to include guitar, piano, and percussion. Raisen, who helped craft the sounds of Sky Ferreira, Kim Gordon, Yves Tumor, and Charli XCX, brings a similar controlled chaos to the album.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The album feels a bit like a sculpture put together from found objects. Ives jumps from channeling the ghost of Ric Ocasek with new wave guitar lines on &ldquo;Shelly&rdquo; and &ldquo;On The Ground&rdquo; to toy-sounding keyboards, simple programmed beats and pitch-shifted vocals on proto-R&amp;B tracks like &ldquo;Lullaby.&rdquo; On &ldquo;Angel of Business,&rdquo; she throws around corporate buzz phrases with lines like, &ldquo;I could circle back three hundred times, the numbers I could show&rdquo; to go with the glitch-hop beats.</p>
<p><em>Janky Star</em> showcases Ives' unusual musical sensibilities and the range of her influences. The strength and versatility of her voice pairs well with the breadth of her sonic expression. If you like off-kilter pop, prepare to be delighted by this record.</p>

			 <p>I have been thinking recently about trying out federated social media site Mastodon. I&rsquo;m interested in non-algorithmic microblogging and solutions that don&rsquo;t actively attempt to antagonize me. Cherie Baker recently joined Mastodon and has some good things to say about her experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To my surprise, I like it! Mastodon + blog feels like a comfortable setup. In truth, shoehorning Twitter-like activity into a blog format always felt awkward to me. I’m not going to “live tweet” a movie on my blog, there are no silly gifs conversations here, and my blog has no good options for ephemerality other than lots of manual deletions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can relate to it feeling awkward tweet-size posts into a main blog. It makes some sense to keep short updates separate. I also learned about features that I didn&rsquo;t know existed in Mastodon from Baker&rsquo;s post — such as the ability to set posts to auto delete unless you mark them for retention. That pairs well with the transient nature of many microblog posts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not sure that I need a service that is such a direct Twitter replacement, though, so I&rsquo;ll think before I leap into another pond.</p>

			 <p>I posted a video from Atlanta&rsquo;s Bailey Crone, AKA Bathe Alone, just a few months ago. I had to share the video from one of her more recent singles, though, because it&rsquo;s one of my favorite songs this year. &ldquo;Decades and Dreams,&rdquo; which was written after Crone practically kidnapped her best friend and took her to a Beach House show seven hours away, sounds wistful and mature. The video is just fun and sweet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The single artwork and music video for &ldquo;Decades &amp; Dreams&rdquo; were inspired by old photos of both of her great-grandmothers on a boating trip together, &ldquo;where they looked completely miserable,&rdquo; says Crone. The video shows Bailey and her best friend — and inspiration behind the actual song — made up in full grandma finery, complete with chunky orange life vests and curly gray hair. The two share a toast to nostalgia and relive youthful adventures in the bittersweet visual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Melodic exhales form the backing vocals and mellotron (my favorite) is prominent in the song&rsquo;s instrumentation. The simple guitar line adds some emotional heft to the nostalgia.</p>

			 <p>This article by Nellie Bowles about the downfall of San Francisco and how it precipitated the ouster of DA Chesa Boudin was so fascinating I could hardly put it down. It has the narrative style of an engrossing book. Bowles provides a cautionary tale of what can take place when left-leaning city politics get out of control.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What happened to the man at the Safeway, what happened to Dustin Walker—these are parables of a sort of progressive-libertarian nihilism, of the belief that any intervention that has to be imposed on a vulnerable person is so fundamentally flawed and problematic that the best thing to do is nothing at all. Anyone offended by the sight of the suffering is just judging someone who’s having a mental-health episode, and any liberal who argues that the state can and should take control of someone in the throes of drugs and psychosis is basically a Republican. If and when the vulnerable person dies, that was his choice, and in San Francisco we congratulate ourselves on being very accepting of that choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bowles also touches upon the ouster of the school board members. The story about how the members tried to outdo each other with how many boxes of intersectionality they could check off was bananas.</p>

			 <p>I wrote recently about how I&rsquo;d prefer to express my views about a given subject by writing about them. It&rsquo;s easier for me to write about something in a blog post and then point people to that blog post than to discuss the subject in conversation. If the subject is something in which I&rsquo;m interested, I can be effusive, talking too much and not being appropriately succinct. If it&rsquo;s something that aggravates me, I can get too angry.</p>
<p>Becca Rothfeld goes a bit farther with this mentality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who in their right mind would want to talk, much less listen, to a person who has contrived to spend as much of her life as possible crouched over her computer in isolation, deleting unsatisfactory variants of a single sentence for upwards of an hour? Nothing in my daily practice has prepared me for the gauntlet of a tête-à-tête. Writing is an antidote to the immediacy and inexactitude of speech, and I resent any attempt to drag me back into the sludge of dialogue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not totally averse to wading into &ldquo;the sludge of dialog,&rdquo; but many times I&rsquo;d rather go through the calculations necessary to write out my thoughts.</p>

			 <p>Ever since she showed up in the band TOPS, I&rsquo;ve thought Marta Cikojevic looked like a 70&rsquo;s icon. Had she been alive at the time, she could have played Kristen Shepard of &ldquo;Who Shot J.R.?&rdquo; fame on <em>Dallas</em>. If that didn&rsquo;t work out, she might have been one of <em>Charley&rsquo;s Angels</em>. So it was no surprise when Cikojevic unleashed a solo project under the name Marci and it sounded like a record that would have been in rotation at Studio 54.</p>
<p>This track hooks you in a disco groove and doesn&rsquo;t let go. TOPS bandmate David Carriere co-wrote the songs on the record originally on Rhodes and bass. It’s evident in “Terminal,” as the bass is the standout instrument and second only to the vocals. The sensual vocals paired with the come hither looks in the video are blushworthy.</p>

<p><strong>I’ve been growing increasingly frustrated with Apple lately.</strong> Apple is a giant company now, as compared to the scrappy upstart they were when I started using their computers in 2005 upon my return to college. A lot has changed. Their workforce and market cap are massive. They are always plowing forward at breakneck speed now, sometimes at the expense of their users and their products.</p>
<h2 id="screen-time">Screen Time</h2>
<p>The first thoughts I had following the Apple Worldwide Developer’s Conference Keynote this week centered around iPadOS 16. It’s ironic that Apple is now advertising <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-16-preview/">new Parental Controls with iPadOS 16</a> when the existing ones don’t work. I have had a support ticket open with Apple going on nine months now about how the Downtime feature with Screen Time doesn’t function properly. I set limits on my son’s iPad gaming usage, and then frequently find him going over those limits just by noticing that he’s been playing games for a long time. When I check, the Screen Time limits have reset themselves to be disabled.</p>
<p>I’ve set screen time limits for myself, and they generally last 2-3 days before resetting. Once I’ve realized things have reset, I have to go and turn the feature back on again, and specify all the exceptions. Then, a couple of days later, I have to do it over again. I have spent hours on the phone with Apple support troubleshooting, only for them to tell me it’s a known issue in development, and they just haven’t fixed it yet. My emails to follow-up are ignored. Each time I call — which I did again a couple of weeks ago — the support rep walks me through all sorts of troubleshooting that I’ve already done, then disappears for a while, and then comes back and tells me that they are aware of the issue and that others are reporting it. They still have no ETA on a fix. Six months ago, they told me a fix should be coming soon, and they would do something special for me and my son for our patience. They haven’t fixed the bug or done anything special for us.</p>
<p>As someone who works in software development and spent ten years as a QA Manager, my advice for Apple would be to fix the breaking feature bugs before adding on to that same feature. It makes absolutely no sense to add anything to Screen Time or Parental Controls when the basic functionality doesn’t even work. This is a critical feature for me, as a parent. I need to be able to regulate my child’s screen time. Being able to control your child’s technology usage is not a nice-to-have, it’s an expectation these days. If the issue isn’t resolved, I will need to move my child to another platform where I can ensure he has appropriate limits. I’m starting to look at a Microsoft Surface tablet to replace his iPad. A tablet running Windows would give him the ability to run more games, anyway.</p>
<h2 id="forced-obsolescence">Forced Obsolescence</h2>
<p>Another thing that I quickly realized regarding the announcement of iPadOS 16 was that I wouldn’t be able to run the signature feature, Stage Manager, on the iPad Air I bought new <strong>last year</strong>. That’s right, Apple products are obsolete after a single year. Had I known last year that I wouldn’t be able to run the multitasking features that were coming out in one year, I wouldn’t have purchased the iPad. Between the high-priced super Smart Keyboard and the tablet itself, the total was over a grand.</p>
<p>As regular readers of my blog and newsletter will know, I’ve been dealing with disabling illness for the past couple of years and I can’t be spending a ton of money on computers that are out-of-date within a year. It would be fine if the iPad could serve as my only computer, but that functionality (being able to work effectively with an external screen) is a part of the Stage Manager feature. Therefore, I still have to maintain another desktop computer. If I want to be able to sync my software between the desktop computer and the tablet, those devices both have to be from Apple.</p>
<p>When I told my boss about the fact that my almost-new iPad wouldn’t be getting the new features, he laughed at me and said that was typical for Apple. He cynically chalks it up to Apple trying to gin up more sales. Getting laughed at is something I’ve gotten used to as an Apple user over the last few years, but I’ve got to say, this time it stung because he’s right. This situation is ridiculous, and I feel like a sucker.</p>
<h2 id="sticky-ecosystem">Sticky Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Apple has a very sticky ecosystem. Not only does buying more of <em>their</em> products ensure that your devices play together nicely, but they also have the healthiest independent developer community of any platform. For example, I can’t think of a single RSS reader on Windows.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Nor can I think of a Markdown text editor that can post to a blogging engine. On the Mac there are many. As a power user, I’m not confident that you can even switch to Linux or Windows without giving up many capabilities provided by independent software. This is the situation, even though Apple, by many people’s estimates, does not treat their developers well.</p>
<p>So as my frustration with Apple grows, I’m almost equally frustrated with companies like Microsoft for failing to make a platform as compelling as Apple’s for the personal computer developer and user. If one could do the same things on Windows that you can do on the Mac, it would provide Apple with more competition and a level of accountability from which their current hegemony in certain areas protects them.</p>
<p>I doubt I will be switching away from Apple at this point, but I’m trying to think of ways to become less dependent on them for my computing, especially when it comes to my hobbies.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I tried to help a colleague with finding an RSS reader for Windows or Linux recently and couldn’t think of anything.

			 <p>A colleague was just telling me about how he hasn&rsquo;t watched the news for approximately three years. He found himself getting so agitated by both sides of the political spectrum and the way the news was presented, that he just quit cold turkey. He feels like he&rsquo;s much happier for the change, and his wife fills him in if something major happens.</p>
<p>It seems as if I&rsquo;m hearing about more and more people who decide that giving up social media is not enough to keep their frustration in check. Cheri Baker points out that it&rsquo;s not just social media that plays with our emotions.</p>

<p>I think at least a part of the problem with modern media is that it&rsquo;s very seldom objective. It can seem almost insulting in its naked biases. In the provocatively titled piece — <a href="https://human-as-media.com/2022/05/01/disinformation-is-no-danger-fear-polarization/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">Disinformation is no danger. Fear polarization</a> from Humans As Media — Andrey Mir argues that we have entered a postjournalism era. The article is an excerpt from Mir’s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GWWXDG7" title="Postjournalism and the death of newspapers. The media after Trump: manufacturing anger and polarization.">Postjournalism and the death of newspapers. The media after Trump: manufacturing anger and polarization</a>. Postjournalism represents the shift from presenting the news to presenting the news with a built-in guiding narrative.</p>
<p>Mir defines <strong>postjournalism</strong> as normative.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2022/939b789160.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Mir details what makes postjournalism different from the journalism that came before it. While the distinction has always been obvious in media organizations like Fox News, it is now evident in organizations like NPR and others that would still probably attempt to claim objectivity.</p>

			 <p>Basic Apple Guy <a href="https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/wwdc22-bingo">pulled together a WWDC bingo card</a>. He has some ideas about what may turn up at the conference next week. Some come from the rumor mill and some are wishful thinking. I thought that it was interesting that he speculates about a classical music service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There have been rumours that Apple will introduce some classical app/service for Apple Music. Whether that becomes a separate app or an enhancement to the Music app, I&rsquo;m not sure, but I expect I&rsquo;ll make finding and curating classical collection far more manageable than asking, &ldquo;Hey Siri, play: Cantata No. 89 Was Soll Ich Aus Dir Machen, Ephraim?, BWV 89: V. Aria - ‘Gerechter Gott, Ach, Rechnest Du?’ [Soprano] by Ad Mater, Gustav Leonhardt &amp; Monteverdi Choir Hamburg&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to see if this comes to fruition, but if it does, I highly doubt there will be a separate app for it.</p>

<p>Lumenette is a new musical project from Christine Byrd (Hammock contributor and wife of musician Mark Byrd). “I’m a Sensory Explosion” is the first Hammock single to credit Lumenette as a cowriter. The song is a beautiful, elegiac exploration of opening your senses to the sometimes overwhelming weight of the natural world. The textures of the song are soothingly familiar to long-time Hammock devotees and Christine’s vocals add a traditional 4AD/shoegaze sound. The track is perhaps best listened to on a cloudy, rainy day.</p>
<p>This is a promising taste of what is to come from Lumenette. The new musical project will certainly bear some of the hallmarks of the Hammock sound. I’m eagerly anticipating the full album.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lumenette’s first long-player, <em>All Around My Head</em>, will be released on 8/12/2022. The first proper single is due out this month, 6/17.</p>

			 <p>Matthew Ismael Ruiz writes for Pitchfork as an obsessive digital music collector. He shuns all-you-can-eat streaming services, instead opting to patronize sites like Bandcamp, that allow downloads and ownership of digital music files. He acknowledges that he is in the minority in our entertainment post-ownership culture, but is aware that there are others like him. They, too, accept the overhead of maintaining a digital music collection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though the ranks of digital collectors have shrunk in the streaming era, I’m certainly not alone. So what kind of person does this? Digital collectors largely are collectors first and foremost—people who enjoy, at least to some degree, the meticulous organization the activity requires. To maintain a digital collection for years and years requires a mix of passion, knowledge, and more than a little bit of obsession. Digital collectors are often—but not always—gearheads and audiophiles fixated on fidelity. They’re people with appetites for music that far outstrip their budgets for physical media. And they tend to be, as I’m devastated to admit, people of a certain age, music fans that grew up organizing files and folders in a way seemingly alien to young people whose main interface with digital files is a search bar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can relate to Ruiz’s piece, but I can’t imagine myself abandoning the embarrassment of riches that streaming music services provide anytime soon. My preference is a mixed catalog, such as what Apple Music provides, where you can incorporate your downloaded rare tracks into your streaming library.</p>

			 <p>Lauren Goode wants to bring back the age of presence indicators — like the AIM Away Messages — to give us all a break from the burden of synchronous communications.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I miss Away Messages. This nostalgia is layered in abstraction; I probably miss the newness of the internet of the 1990’s, and I also miss just being … away. But this is about Away Messages themselves. The bits of code that constructed Maginot Lines around our availability. An Away Message was a text box full of possibilities, a mini-MySpace profile or a Facebook status update years before either existed. It was also a boundary: An Away Message not only popped up as a response after someone IM’ed you, it was wholly visible to that person before they IM’ed you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really like the presence indicator, but I think, in terms of tech culture, we’ve moved past the barrier that “away” messages put up. People with whom I work ignore the presence indicator in Teams. It’s not unusual to have multiple people trying to message me, while my Teams message clearly says that I’m on the phone.</p>

<p>I have a Kobo Libra 2 ereader, and it’s one of my favorite devices. Of course, it is used for reading books, but I spend just as much time reading articles saved from the internet. I find I have a much greater capacity for reading long materials passed from the internet on an e-ink device. I’m using Pocket as my read-it-later service, and it syncs well with the Kobo. It’s a 2-way sync, so you can favorite and archive articles from the device.</p>
<p>Other read-it-later services, such as Instapaper and Matter, have a 1-way push to the Kindle, but anything you do on the Kindle does not sync back to the service. While a 2-way sync is intrinsically superior to a 1-way sync, how the sync fits within your workflow determines how much more useful it is. In my case, I mainly use the 2-way Pocket sync on my Kobo to sync favorites back to the service, so I can go back to them on an iOS device and make highlights from there — something you cannot do on the Kobo. Readwise (I’m on a free trial of that service) syncs the highlighted passages and other metadata from Pocket to Obsidian. I pull article information from Obsidian into Ulysses to write about it. I’m doing that part manually. I don’t yet have it automated, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqTyyQBi3hA">like Matt Bircher</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<p>Although my workflow is okay, it’s a bit more manual than I would like. It would be much easier, for example, if I could highlight article passages on my Kobo and have them automatically sync to Obsidian, as I can do with books. Since I have to go back to my iOS devices to create highlights, the 2-way sync is of somewhat limited usefulness, in my case. It is hardly superior to the 1-way push from Instapaper or Matter to the Kindle, where I have to go back to my iOS device for article management, anyway.</p>
<p>Where Instapaper and Matter end up being superior to Pocket is in the management of highlights. Through a third party service like Readwise — that has a non-trivial monthly subscription fee — Pocket has decent highlights management. On its own, extracting highlights from the service is difficult. From the web interface, you can only copy a link to the article from the highlight. Inexplicably, there is no way to pull out highlights without going through a standard copy and paste, which makes the usefulness of highlights themselves low. On iOS, you can extract the highlights through the share button, but not many programs can accept the output and most only show a link to the article. Ulysses, for instance, only occasionally captures the quote. I would love to see the folks behind Pocket come up with better options for highlight export. Perhaps even an image you can share on your blog or social media, like many other services, such as Glasp or Matter, would be nice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have low confidence in the ongoing development of Pocket. The “what’s new” section of their web app has not been updated for almost a year. Their parent company, Moz://a, is consistently in financial trouble. Theoretically, Pocket as a revenue stream should help, but their pay tier offerings have very little value add. I’m at a loss for what $5 a month gets you over the free tier, except more than 3 highlights per article, additional fonts and tag suggestions. I find 3 highlights per article to be plenty for most pieces, I’m fine with the Graphik font, and I can create my own tag taxonomy. One of the tags I use is an @[name] tag to remember where I found the link, so I can provide proper attribution if I write about the piece on my blog. I doubt Pocket is going to suggest tags that would fit in such a custom system.</p>
<h2 id="matter">Matter</h2>
<p>In contrast to the slow pace of Pocket development, Matter has been aggressively improving their app. They just launched version 2.0, in what, I believe, is less than a year after the original 1.0 release. Version numbers don’t necessarily convey the pace of change, but in this case, the application was redesigned for the second release. The first version of the app was frequently criticized for being too cluttered. <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/nucleus">Matter 2.0</a> removed the social experience, which is better left up to dedicated social media platforms, and received a largely positive response from users.</p>
<p>Matter is based on the premise that the modern reading economy is being  constructed by individual writers rather than aggregates of writers brought together by publications. So, it builds in what is essentially an RSS reader for blogs and newsletters, based around writers. The creators are betting that the kind of app will become increasingly necessary in a fragmented reading environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still, we can predict a few things with confidence: The supply of great content will continue to rise (and nichify), attention will always be scarce, and the returns to making good decisions about what to read will remain high — and indeed, increase — over time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paradigm seems to work fairly well, with the writers you would expect being recognized by the system and made easy to follow and more writers being added all the time.</p>
<h2 id="ereaders">Ereaders</h2>
<p>Coming back to the reading experience on an ereader, Matter lets you <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/94ef8b6ba6d443a4a373690d51d987bb">push articles individually to Kindle</a>. The feature assumes that you don’t want to automatically sync <em>all</em> of your saved articles to your ereader. It also assumes that you don’t necessarily want to send all the articles in your <em>inbox</em> to your ereader (like Instapaper does). While the Pocket/Kobo integration is smart enough not to send things like videos or articles that can’t be parsed to the Kobo, you still get everything else, which can be a plus or minus, depending on your workflow.</p>
<p>I might be ready to dive further into the Matter ecosystem as a forward-looking alternative to Pocket, but am I prepared to get back into the world of Amazon reading with the Kindle? Despite <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2021/08/10/conscientious-consumerism-and.html">my strong feelings toward Amazon</a>, I’m considering it. I’m glad I’ve got an old Kindle to try a new process on, so I don’t have to jump in without seeing what this looks like.</p>

			 <p>Claymorphism seems to be the rage now in web design. This style, which may remind you of your favorite claymation shows, has a very playful look. Andrian Bece <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/03/claymorphism-css-ui-design-trend/">writes about the style</a> for Smashing Magazine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Claymorphism builds on top of Neumorphism foundations. Although both use rounded corners, they differ in how they use backgrounds and shadow. Instead of using light and dark outer shadow to achieve the extrusion effect, Claymorphism uses two inner shadows (dark and light) and an outer (usually darker) shadow to achieve a soft 3D and floating effect. This allows for Claymorphism to have any background color, independent of the background which was a major drawback with Neumorphism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve actually played around with added a little claymorphism to my blog, but it just didn’t look right to my eyes, though it does typically pair well with flat elements. I noticed that Glasp, <a href="https://glasp.co/home">the service for saving quotes from the web</a>, is <a href="https://twitter.com/_glasp/status/1529960407544127488?s=21&amp;t=LAY3AgOkn43b7RNwQqWrLA">getting a bit of a facelift</a> that borrows from the claymorphism trend.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2022/3f5d3303d8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The style may not be for my projects, but I have to admit it is fun.</p>

			 <p>Andy Phelps writes about how, growing up in California, near Edwards Air Force base, he had to deal with the constant reminders of the possibility of nuclear war. To cope with the existential dread, he found comfort in an arcade game: <strong>Missile Command</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But in that moment, playing Missile Command was transformative: it provided a way for me to process my frustration, my fear, and my anger. It offered an outlet for my grief, and it also, amazingly, provided a sense of agency and control over a situation in which I had none of either. While the hopelessness of my plight was being reflected in the press covering the Cold War, in popular music on MTV, and in the comic books and action heroes of the day, Missile Command did a unique and (at least to me) profound thing: it didn’t offer some escapist view of the situation — everyone that plays the game eventually loses — but it did offer both a way to trivialize and compartmentalize the fear (it is, after all, an arcade game and you can play it again with a quarter so there is always another life) — while simultaneously holding out the idea that you can win for a while, and for a pretty significant while at that. You can laugh at yourself for the stress you feel while playing the final moments of the game, and then savor the fact that you’re still alive in the arcade and get a piece of pizza.</p>

			 <p>Author of <em>Deep Work</em>, <em>Digital Minimalism</em> and other tech-adjacent books, Cal Newport, talks about the perks of living without social media in <a href="https://youtu.be/m6AF_aFuD8w">this video</a>.</p>
<p>He comes up with 4 points:</p>
<ol>
<li>You will be bored more often but that boredom will lead to good things.</li>
<li>Your anxiety will be lower, because the world constructed by your mind is constructed by what you pay attention to. If you are paying attention to social media, that will be a grim and unsettling world.</li>
<li>You’ll have more privacy. Human beings are not wired to have amorphous large crowds of strangers watching their reaction to news and have heated interactions back and forth with strangers.</li>
<li>It will lower your sense of self-importance and will lead you seek importance in real and tangible ways.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having taken time off from social media recently, I can validate that what Newport outlines is accurate. However, you also have to be careful about what else you consume. If you switch social media for online news from your most trusted sources — because they share your beliefs about who the “bad people” are — you won’t eliminate numbers 1 and 2. That will mean you don’t end up much better off. Your substitutions have to make sense.</p>

<p>A lot of times, when I watch movies that pit good vs. evil in easily distinguishable sides, I wonder about someone actually choosing a path that is clearly evil. Take Star Wars, for example. Why would someone choose to be on the dark side, with all the available evidence that it&rsquo;s just <em>evil</em>? There are moments when I have trouble suspending my disbelief. George Lucas tried hard to make Anakin&rsquo;s descent into the evil persona of Darth Vader believable, but it was still rough around the edges. The depiction of evil in movies can be so exaggerated as to be cartoonish.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t just set out one day and decide that they are going to be bad. So, in the movies, when some kind of transformation happens, it&rsquo;s hard not to give it a little extra scrutiny as a plot device. Good films usually show some slow decent into evil. We say, “The path to hell is paved with good intentions,” and it’s usually one little thing that leads to another. A kind of breadcrumb trail that a person follows until they find themselves out in the middle of the dark forest, lost and confused, and they think that wrong is right.</p>
<p>Then, it turns out, some people are okay with embracing evil. Madison Cawthorn, who just lost his reelection campaign to the House of Representatives, is <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article261615122.html">calling on the power of Dark MAGA</a> to avenge him. Dark MAGA refers to a group whose main political platform is revenge. The reason the third (oh okay, call it the sixth) Star Wars movie was retitled The <em>Return of the Jedi</em> from <em>The Revenge of the Jedi</em> was that revenge is not a virtuous pursuit. The realization was that truly good people, as represented in the films by the Jedi, do not seek revenge.</p>
<p>The Dark MAGA adherents are consumed with the destruction of their perceived enemies. They are, in the mode of high fantasy like Star Wars, choosing the dark side, the side of the Sith. It’s all as ridiculous as it sounds. It would be laughable, except when you think of the reality that Cawthorn was elected once, and not trounced in his reelection bid. Now it’s a little too close to be humorous.</p>

<p>I love how Hollie Cook is able to blend reggae and dream pop vibes on “Full Moon Baby.” I enjoyed Cook&rsquo;s first album, <em>Vessel of Love</em> when it came out in 2018, but there&rsquo;s something unique about this track.</p>
<p>This is how you do crossover. It feels like the way forward when even pioneering genres are beginning to retread the same ground over and over again. Almost no stone has been left unturned in even some of my favorite musical styles. I&rsquo;ll always enjoy the familiar, but I&rsquo;m eager to hear new ways to blend styles and create something that speaks of novelty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a <em>huge</em> fan of reggae, but I&rsquo;ve never disliked it, either. Even if it was a crutch for some of <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/42216-2/">the early music by The Police</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sting: The other nice thing about playing a reggae groove in the verses was that you could leave holes in the music. I needed those holes because, initially, I had a hard time singing and playing at the same time. So if we had a signature in the band it was…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Andy Summers: Big holes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not too long before my grandfather died, he offered me his collection of reggae cassettes. I declined the offer (cassettes were not the coveted items they&rsquo;ve now become, at the time). What if I had accepted the offer? Would my music tastes be totally different now?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided I need to introduce some changes to how I post online. I typically write a lot of link posts because I read quite a bit online and want to share things that I think are interesting. This comes from a desire to add my thoughts to what is put out there by others, and — let’s face it — comment sections are a pretty bad way to do it. Lately, though, a lot of what I see online has to do with the outrage of the week. “Outrage of the week” sounds like some cute embellishment, but it has become literally accurate. Every week, the people on the internet collectively lose their minds about a particular subject. Then, everyone gives a hot take on that subject. When the next week hits, there’s a new subject to write about. It has become an all-too-familiar standard pattern.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that these subjects aren’t truly outrageous (the war in Ukraine being a particularly potent example). With so many people writing about the same thing, though, adding another voice to the chorus doesn’t always feel appropriate or effective. Former religion advisor to President Obama, Micheal Wear, recently <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelrwear/status/1523390036867125248?s=21&amp;t=oRJAm-Yq1XzZAERwwEip7g">tweeted about this</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2022/41da6f0011.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I want to continue to <strong>read</strong> about these issues, I’m just not sure that I wish to write about them. Even in the vastness of the World Wide Web, escaping “the outrage” and reading and writing about something different can be difficult. So, I’m going to slow down on link posting in the way that I have been doing it. I’ll still be blogging. I just don’t want to commit to a weekly email, in case, on any given week, I just can’t find enough that I want to write about. At least not enough to write about without getting sucked into the outrage.</p>
<p>Luke Harrington writes about how the outrage of the week <a href="https://luketharrington.substack.com/p/i-took-a-break-from-social-media">drove him off social media</a>. He understood that there were good people on either side of the issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I knew, though, that social media would not show me evidence of this. I knew the moment I opened Facebook or Twitter, I would be assaulted by a bottomless column of self-righteous gloating from one side and self-righteous screeching from the other. That I’d be forced to re-read the exact same shouting matches I’d seen rehearsed ad nauseam for decades. That panicky, breathless misinformation would spread like chlamydia, and the most ignorant, unthinking voices would be amplified to deafening levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A news story, told by a mob of idiots, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to write about what&rsquo;s going on in the world when social media is bringing us down to the lowest common denominator. Even long-time blogger Jason Kottke <a href="https://kottke.org/22/05/announcement-im-going-to-miss-you-but-i-am-taking-a-sabbatical">is taking a sabbatical</a> from his general purpose blog.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does what I do here make a difference in other people’s lives? In my life? Is this still scratching the creative itch that it used to? And if not, what needs to change? Where does kottke.org end and Jason begin? Who am I without my work? Is the validation I get from the site healthy? Is having to be active on social media healthy? Is having to read the horrible news every day healthy? What else could I be doing here? What could I be doing somewhere else? What good is a blog without a thriving community of other blogs? I’ve tried thinking about these and many other questions while continuing my work here, but I haven’t made much progress; I need time away to gain perspective.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be interesting to see if Jason comes back, or if he decides that having to follow what is going on around the internet is too mentally taxing and not worth the effort and the return.</p>
<p>Similarly, I won&rsquo;t be doing &ldquo;Week on the Web&rdquo; digests for the foreseeable future. I would rather not have to be tethered too tightly to what is going on in the web version of purgatory. I&rsquo;m not some alchemist who can turn the lead of internet sentiment into the gold of something edifying. When I was using HEY World, I was writing longer posts and sending them out through email, RSS and the open web. That process didn’t require that I follow current events so closely.</p>
<h2 id="hey-world">HEY World</h2>
<p>Using HEY World by 37signals worked pretty well for general purpose ad hoc blogging, but it is a very limited tool. That&rsquo;s mostly a feature, not a bug, but in some cases, it can be frustrating. For example, when HEY added scheduling for emails, they left it half-baked into their implementation of HEY World. You get an error, though, when you try to use it. I messaged their support folks about it, and it sounds like they have no plans to fix the bug. I find that strange, since the whole point of HEY World is that it makes blogging as easy as sending email. You would think they would want to keep the email features, like scheduling — that make sense for blogging — intact for HEY World.</p>
<p>There are other, more important ways, that HEY World feels like an experiment that 37signals is not pursuing further.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> For instance, when you export your data out of HEY, you only get your standard emails, and not the ones that have been sent to the web. This means that any blog posts you write in HEY are stuck there and disappear when you leave the service. If you spend time on your writing, and attach some value to it, that should be a deal-breaker. It certainly is for me. So, I won&rsquo;t be using HEY World for blogging anymore, <em>unless I can find a good way to back up my work</em>. Given my picky nature about blogging and the fact that HEY is lacking in customization or the ability to use your own domain, it was always a long shot that it would stick, anyway.</p>
<h2 id="newsletters">Newsletters</h2>
<p>Something that HEY World gets absolutely right is the ability to post across delivery mechanisms and have it look virtually the same on every client. However, I don&rsquo;t need HEY to do that. Both Micro.blog and Ghost do something similar, just a bit differently.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> For the purposes of this post, I will stick with describing Micro.blog, since that is currently my blogging platform of choice.</p>
<p>Micro.blog gives you three options for how to implement newsletters, and I think they are all well-designed for different use cases.</p>
<ol>
<li>Send email for each long blog post with a title</li>
<li>Collect all short microblog posts and long posts into a weekly email</li>
<li>Collect posts from a category into a monthly email</li>
</ol>
<p>I have been using the second option to produce an email digest each week, for folks who may not be following my blog via RSS. I&rsquo;m going to switch to sending out long posts via email, like I was doing with HEY World. This means I can take the time to write longer posts with greater thought put into them. I won&rsquo;t feel as if I need to fill the week with link posts while dodging the outrage.</p>
<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h2>
<p>I love writing out my feelings. It&rsquo;s cathartic, therapeutic and most of all, fun. I want to continue to do so, but I need to focus more on less. This was the idea I had when I briefly shifted to HEY World, but there&rsquo;s no reason I can&rsquo;t do it on Micro.blog. That platform allows me to post whatever I want and distribute that content in the ways that make the most sense.</p>

			 <p>I love <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/geteilte-kirche-am-kreuzbichl">this story</a> of a Catholic church in Austria that actually has a road running through it. At Sankt Maria, the pastor preaches from one side of the road, while the congregation sits on the other. The church started its life as a roadside shrine and was later replaced by a chapel.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2022/d70891602a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It sounds like the chapel is not regularly used, and the road going through it is now a bypass, so there’s less traffic than there used to be. Still, the idea of a pastor having to pause his sermon for traffic is a strange one.</p>

<p>The church is regularly renovated and thus preserved, though today only a few regular services are held there. Preservation is carried out by the city of Gmünd, because in the 19th century the community representatives committed themselves by a document to keep the church forever, and this document is binding.</p>

<p>This would be a fascinating place to visit someday.</p>

			 <p>Wordle seems to have been a boon for the New York Times, bringing millions of new users to the site and helping to add subscribers, as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall, the Times said it added 387,000 net digital-only subscribers last quarter, though it didn’t say how many of those are Wordle players. The Times also offers a dedicated subscription to its cooking content, and an overall digital package.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I kind of wondered how much the acquisition of the popular word game would help The Times. They had indicated that the game would only be free temporarily and it&rsquo;s unclear if they could convert its fanbase to paying customers. If it continues to be a gateway to subscriptions, though, they could keep it free indefinitely, which would be good for everyone. I&rsquo;m still playing the game almost every day and enjoying it, having only lost once.</p>

<p>Lois M. Collins <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2022/4/25/23025656/the-contrarian-liz-bruenig-progressive-catholic-atlantic-theology">has a profile</a> of Elizabeth Bruenig, whom I’ve long admired, for Deseret News. The basis for the piece is Bruenig’s unusual (for these days, anyway) blend of faith and politics. She doesn’t fit neatly into the proscribed categories that we have packaged up for easy consumption and advocacy. She’s strongly left on economics, somewhat to the right socially and, as a staunch Catholic, pro-life (womb to tomb) and has done quite a bit of investigative journalism on the death penalty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elizabeth Bruenig makes no apologies. Not for her progressive politics, not for her Catholic faith and certainly not for having children at an age some of the left intelligentsia find unfashionable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though Bruenig’s blend of progressive economic politics, socially conservative politics and Catholicism seems out-of-place in the modern zeitgeist, I personally don’t find it inconsistent at all. After all, progressive politics tends to be much more supportive of serving the poor and disenfranchised, which was one of Jesus’ major concerns. He taught us to serve the poor in particularly urgent language in parables such as the one commonly referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sheep_and_the_Goats">The Sheep and the Goats</a>. While some Christian sects like to talk about people going to hell if they don’t accept Christ as their savior, Jesus himself indicated that you would be headed that way if you don’t help your fellow human beings who are struggling in this particular parable.</p>
<p>Jesus was pretty conservative on social issues like marriage. He believed that, for instance, divorce was to be avoided in all but the most extreme situations. Historically, this has been the position of the church and the governments that came from majority Judeo-Christian backgrounds. It wasn’t until California instituted the no-fault divorce just decades ago that it became easy to get a divorce in the United States.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="she-likes-to-quote-lena-dunham-in-some-ways-her-political-opposite-who-said-im-not-for-everyone">She likes to quote Lena Dunham (in some ways, her political opposite), who said, “I’m not for everyone.”</h3>
<hr>
<p>In fact, Bruenig’s alignment with the values of the early Christian church shows how disordered our modern political divisions of left and right really are when compared against a background of religious faith. To paraphrase a recent statement by <a href="https://robertsapunarich.com">blogger Robbie Sapunarich</a>, I’m not sure we should take our terminology from the French Revolution.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The modern political binaries are arbitrary or sometimes practical, like drawing boundaries for a state or town. They are only there because we have erected them for the purposes of lowering cognitive load and making it easier to digest complex issues. Why think individual issues out &mdash; with all of their nuances and different applications to different people &mdash; when you can just get a whole package of beliefs handed to you?</p>
<p>I read posts from a lot of people who are either cleanly on the one side or the other. You can guess what their opinion will be on any given political issue, based on the package they have accepted. While I like these people (or I wouldn’t be following them in the first place), I have to take what they are writing with a lower expectation that they’ve actually thought the issue through. Maybe they have, but it’s more likely they’re just regurgitating what their favorite political team’s talking points. It’s going to be somewhat less interesting to me at best (frustrating, at worst) if someone doesn’t have their own, unique take on things.</p>
<p>As Bruenig has discovered, mostly through her presence on social media, a lot of people don’t like independent thinkers. Peter Wason didn’t pull the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a> from nowhere. Most people have a reactionary view on hot button issues, and like to read whatever confirms their initial view. They don’t like challenges to that view, which put them in a defensive posture. Online, this defensiveness can come out as rage.</p>
<p>It’s good that Bruenig doesn’t put too much stock in the social media outrage machine, because she wouldn’t have lasted this long in the online world if she did. She likes to quote Lena Dunham (in some ways, her political opposite), <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/11/lena-dunham-comes-to-terms-with-herself.html">who said</a>, “I’m not for everyone.”</p>

The post about the change is a pretty standard corporate announcement, which is unusual for Fried.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>37signals makes Basecamp, 37signals makes HEY, and 37signals will make more products soon, too. We&rsquo;re starting on our next one this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Philpin <a href="https://john.philpin.com/2022/05/04/signals-hello-again.html">wonders why he should care</a> about the rename. I’m personally happy to see the change because it reflects an equal commitment to the HEY email product (which is excellent, and I love using) and to putting out new products. While I think the Basecamp app is neat, I will never be able to use it at work, whereas I have discretion to use whatever email I want personally. So, I welcome the shift to inclusion for not only HEY, but the promise of more products to come. Perhaps with the success of HEY, 37signals will continue to drive into the personal application market. That would keep those of us for whom productivity software is not just something we have to put up with at work – but something we enjoy using in our own lives – coming back to 37signals for trusted solutions.</p>

			 <p>I realize that I just pointed to some writing tips from Clive Thompson, but here&rsquo;s another post with some more. Thompson makes his first drafts look totally unlike anything that could be mistaken for something official. For instance, he starts the sentences of those drafts with hyphens and lower case letters and ends them with two forward slashes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But when I write in my strange style, the sentences and paragraphs just seem like jottings. They’re Lego bricks I’m combining and recombining see what shape they might make. Words written with no proper casing and punctuation seem much easier to tear up and revise. I get less emotionally attached.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem with his particular method is that markdown turns hyphens that begin a sentence into bullets. For that, he suggests using a tilde, instead. However, Ulysses treats a tilde as a special character as well. In some text editors, it might be best to come up with your own conventions along the same lines as his.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I liken Twitter to a favorite bar that hateful elements have taken over. Now, you may have found a dark, comfortable corner with your friends and can insulate yourself from the noise, but increasingly, you cannot help but notice all the chaos around you. Lecherous men are hounding women, making lewd gestures, and even people from other tables barging in on your conversations so that they can disrupt you.</p>

<p>This is how Twitter feels to me. Even if you try to insulate yourself from the misconduct, it&rsquo;s all around you. The algorithm is sure to insert reminders of it, lest you ever come close to forgetting.</p>

<p>Captured Tracks recording artist Scout Gillett covers the standout Broadcast track &ldquo;Come On Let&rsquo;s Go&rdquo; on her newest covers EP, <em>One To Ten</em>. I liked the original version of this song, despite the fact that I am always feeling like I&rsquo;m going to get Broadcast mixed up with Stereolab (it&rsquo;s the same sixties space age bachelor pad vibe). It’s an interesting choice for for Gillett, who also covers Brenda Lee’s “I’m Sorry” on the EP &mdash; which sounds completely fitting for her retro country-pop feel.</p>
<p>Here Gillett doesn&rsquo;t shed the Broadcast sound, but adds some punch to the track. There’s a noisy but slow guitar solo that heats things up. Gillett mimes shredding the guitar using a broom in the video. It’s obvious she’s having a lot of fun with this recording, which was originally done in September 2020, at the height of the COVID pandemic, for a tribute compilation to the late Broadcast singer, Trish Keenan. Since the order of the day was to stay home and stay well, any movement outside of out that space was carefully calculated. So the lyrics to the song, which go: “what’s the point in wasting time, with people you’ll never know,” really spoke to Gillette about the current state of affairs. You had to be judicious about who you spent time with and the song, written decades ago, pointed straight at that situation. Her voice sounds less coy than Keenan&rsquo;s does on the song, and Gillett compensates in the video by nodding affirmatively during the chorus. As she sings &ldquo;come on let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; <em>heaven help you if you aren&rsquo;t at least curious to see where Gillett is going to take you.</em></p>

<p>That about sums it up.</p>
<p>I’m not confident that we’ll all of a sudden see huge amounts of users or major celebrities showing up on Micro.blog.

<p>And it’s not just executives: roughly a dozen Twitter employees have been doxxed by trolls in the past few days, I’m told. Sometimes it’s because they were responding to one of Musk’s tweets; other times it has been as simple as employees tweeting that they’re looking for new jobs.</p>

<p>My first thought when read (at the end of a long day of work) that Elon Musk had purchased Twitter, was some measure of disbelief. I&rsquo;m almost embarrassed to admit the second thought that popped into my head after reading the news. Yep, it is definitely with some shame that I tell you my disbelief was quickly followed by relief. I&rsquo;m aware that may be surprising. It surprised me, too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not certain that I&rsquo;ve ever really spent much time writing about Elon Musk, but my feelings toward the man are not very positive. I have spent a lot of time (maybe too much) writing about Twitter, and its many faults. Recently, I took a Lenten break from Twitter and, when I came back, found it pretty unappealing. Someone once joked that the game of Twitter was to not be the person who was being talked about on Twitter on any given day. On the day I came back — Easter Sunday — that person (or those people, rather) was a crew of zealous, evangelistic Christians singing songs about Jesus on an airplane. My whole timeline was filled with what the extremely online call &ldquo;takes&rdquo; about this incident. It didn&rsquo;t leave me wanting more. After seeing recommendations from Twitter, which, as usual, seemed designed to spark outrage, I felt even less inclined to log in. So, I just haven&rsquo;t been on the platform much during this Eastertide.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2022/f8fe7369a4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the midst of my neglect of the Twitter timeline, though, one thing that has been weighing on my mind is Twitter&rsquo;s financial future. You see, I&rsquo;m a TWTR shareholder, conflicted about my distrust of the platform and being financially intertwined with its fate. I have been waiting for a chance to sell my shares at a reasonable price and get out. I now have a way to cash in my chips, not having gained much over the years, but at least some. If I wanted to wash my hands of the whole affair, I could be done with Twitter today. It is somewhat liberating.</p>
<p>When I started writing this post, I thought I was probably mostly alone in my feelings. Then I read <a href="https://500ish.com/twitter-molts-506b291e591f?source=rss-5c6977d2a94f------2">this from M.G. Seigler</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And with the market now in a state of turbulence, the chaos of Elon Musk must have in some ways felt welcoming. A chokehold that felt like a warm embrace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t come up with a better metaphor than &ldquo;a chokehold that felt like a warm embrace.&rdquo; An online place that I used to love has fallen into the hands of a billionaire with an ax to grind, and I feel fine.</p>

			 <p>David French takes on the government in Florida on free speech. Based on his analysis, the state’s removal of Disney’s special tax status as a reprisal for advocating against <em>House Bill 1557</em> should not stand. Corporations cannot be discriminated against by the government for their political affiliations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You get what you ask for” or “they will deserve it” are not principles of constitutional law or a free society. In fact, the opposite is true. The First Amendment affirmatively protects the right of private institutions to engage in political speech, and that protection extends to safeguarding them from government reprisal for their speech.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He references the time in 2019 when San Antonio, TX, tried to ban Chick-fil-A from the airport due to their religious beliefs. The Texas state government acted quickly to protect the restaurant chain from discrimination. The same principle of free speech/freedom of expression applies in the case of Disney.</p>

<p>Sometimes Apple Music inspires me by algorithmically playing fitting sequential songs after a self-made playlist. This happened recently when I had been listening to some tracks I had stuck together and it followed them up with a Chromeo and then a Cut Copy song. I never would have thought to put the two together, but the combo worked really well. I could imagine myself DJ’ing — spinning those tracks back to back to get people moving. That was the inspiration for this playlist, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/dance-music-for-introverts/pl.u-jV89DmJIVYDE4">Dance Music For Introverts</a>. It&rsquo;s a bit of a misnomer, since some of it is just straight up dance music, but it works.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I continue to be amazed by how tightly Apple Music has been tuned since it first debuted. Obviously, whenever you are dealing with machine learning, the more data you have, the better the recommendation engine can be. In this case, after listening to the first few songs I added to the playlist, I was literally thinking, &ldquo;I need to put Toro Y Moi’s &lsquo;New Beat&rsquo; on here.&rdquo; Before I could even do that, Apple Music played the song when the playlist had ended.</p>

			 <p>Clive Thompson wrote an ode <a href="https://medium.com/creators-hub/in-defense-of-the-m-dash-5684b607c87d">to the em dash</a>. After reading his fawning tribute to the multipurpose punctuation, I suddenly have the urge to use it everywhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So it’s a shapeshifter, which makes it hard pin down. Yet that’s also makes it exciting for me — because it suggests you can bust out an m-dash, for, like, no reason at all except that you feel like it.</p>

That mall (Cary Towne Center) has played such a big role in my life. I didn’t work there that long, but I went there probably hundreds of times. Now this means no more of those hot pretzels and massage chairs that were a staple of the mall kiosk landscape. It’s sad to watch the mall get destroyed but I’m glad the spot is going to be used and gain back some of the vitality it lost while the mall was dying.</p>

			 <p>Flickr is making some interesting changes to their Terms of Service. After the changes take effect, if you want to provide <a href="https://www.flickrhelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404064374164-Set-the-Safety-Levels-of-Your-Flickr-Content-or-Account?utm_campaign=flickr-tos-2022&amp;utm_source=Flickr&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=upload_enforcement">moderate or restricted content</a>, you will need to be a paying customer by upgrading to a Pro account.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Free accounts with Restricted or Moderate content will be considered in violation of our terms of service and subject to removal. Accounts found in violation of our terms will need to either subscribe to Flickr Pro or remove the content in violation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The changes make sense, from a cost standpoint. Providing restricted or moderate content necessitates that Flickr provide more resources to content moderation. Therefore, to offset that resource expenditure, they are requiring customers to pay if they want to take advantage of those services.</p>

			 <p>M.G. Seiegler writes about the hypothetical that Microsoft could buy Twitter. Unlike the aspirational aquisition by Elon Musk, Microsoft might actually be a good fit for the platform.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Microsoft has proven themselves good stewards of giant buys. GitHub. Mojang. LinkedIn. The latter might make the bid more complicated as it was once lumped into “social networking”. But obviously Twitter is a different beast. And Microsoft famously/infamously wanted another, newer entrant: TikTok. To the point where they were willing to absurdly and problematically kiss Donald Trump’s ring. That deal didn’t happen. But this could.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Siegler doesn&rsquo;t believe that the Musk deal (which is problematic for a number of reasons) will go through. This leaves Twitter ripe for another company to step in.</p>

			 <p>I really enjoy the roundups that Matt Poppe does of new Disney+ series for <a href="https://christandpopculture.com/">Christ and Pop Culture</a>. From his writing about <em>Moon Knight</em>, it sounds like his background and the churches he&rsquo;s attended give him a particular insight into some of the religious aspects of the new series. Specifically, he addresses how the intentions of followers of a &ldquo;cult of personality&rdquo; type of faith can be misled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like many of us who live and breathe inside circles of faith, Marc (and now Steven) are beginning to realize that leaders who capture our commitment often twist their followers’ zeal and idealism toward their own selfish ends. There you were, happily shedding your time, money, and talents to planting churches throughout India and Ethiopia. It comes as some shock, then, to learn you actually propped up the domestic expansions of <a href="https://www.wthrockmorton.com/tag/mars-hill-global/">Mark Driscoll’s vanity projects</a> instead. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had mixed feelings about the series, so far. I like Oscar Isaac, and I think he&rsquo;s done a fantastic job, but I also feel sometimes like they are trying to stretch his acting skills too far with jamming multiple characters inside his body and it comes out as a bit schizophrenic.</p>

<p>I look at Easter not just as a day, but as a kickoff, if you will, for Eastertide. I see it as somewhat analogous to New Year&rsquo;s Day. Resolutions start then, and don&rsquo;t end when the day is over. Eastertide is a time to look at renewal in your life. If that renewal is simply a present fact, as is my continuing recovery from ME/CFS — thanks be to God — then it is a time for celebration. Sometimes, though, you may have to gently invite that renewal.</p>
<p>Easter is the most important holiday in the Christian calendar and it means a lot to me and other believers. This year, I wanted to write something to convey the beauty of Easter, but I didn’t come across any articles that really sparked my imagination and spurred my writing. Then I realized, while sitting in church, that I had actually already read <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-most-tumultuous-holy-week-easter-south-robert-e-lee-surrender-truce-civil-war-11649975458">a post that spoke to me about Easter</a> in way that was relevant to my recent experiences – that I wanted to share.</p>
<p>Peggy Noonan writes for The Wall Street Journal about “America’s Most Tumultuous Holy Week,” which she believes was the week in April 1865. To make her case, she subtitles her piece: “On Palm Sunday, Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant. Lincoln was dead by Easter.” It’s a pretty strong argument for a superlative level of tumult. What impressed me about her account of the surrender of General Lee to General Grant was the amount of grace that the North gave to the South after such a bloody war. The reason for grace wasn’t that the figures in the North thought that the cause of the South was anything but criminally unjust.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grant would write in his memoirs “What General Lee’s feelings were I do not know.” His own feelings, which had earlier been jubilant, were now “sad and depressed.” He couldn’t rejoice at the downfall of a foe that had “suffered so much for a cause, though that cause was, I believe, one of the worst for which a people ever fought, and one for which there was the least excuse.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m pretty sure I’ve heard those lines before in the Ken Burns Civil War documentary because when I read it, I hear it said, in one of Burns’ reliable narrator’s voices. It shows the disdain that the Union soldiers must have had for the Confederate cause. Yet, when it came time to negotiate the terms of surrender, they were merciful terms. The Confederate soldiers were allowed to keep their personal arms, take a horse or a donkey, were fed and sent on their way back to farm their lands. Noonan relates, &ldquo;Grant’s commissary chief later asked, &lsquo;Were such terms ever before given by a conqueror to a defeated foe?'&rdquo; Perhaps they were, but that kind of treatment is not the standard following a war.</p>
<p>The United States perhaps would not have remained united following the war, were it not for those terms. As I remember why Christ died for us, I like think His sacrifice to earn forgiveness for our sins can be best celebrated by forgiving others. At a time when bickering in this country happens over seemingly everything, this Easter reminds me that we can be reconciled over even some of the most difficult things.</p>

<p>In 2019, I participated in what is called a Leadership 360 assessment. This particular survey is based on principles from <a href="https://zengerfolkman.com/">Zenger Folkman</a>. The purpose of this survey is to help you identify your strengths and become even stronger in those areas. The assessment seeks to answer the question of what differentiates you as a leader. The premise is that you can’t make a leader great by taking an area where they are weak and making them a bit stronger in that area so that they become potentially average. However, if you can take something they are already good out and make them great at it, you can augment the skills of someone who can actually influence others.</p>
<p>When I took the survey, my strongest areas were honesty and integrity. We decided to hone in on those areas for my leadership development activities. Given the identification of strength in those areas and a commitment toward further development of honesty and integrity, I am sensitive to distrust. There are all sorts of ways people can express distrust these days. I wrote <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2021/10/27/tcd-total-cost.html">a post describing a few of the ways</a> I have felt distrusted in the past. Distrust can involve individual or group dynamics. It can be the result of previous negative experiences that have conditioned someone to be doubtful of either other’s intentions or their presentation of truth, as I outlined in the piece. However, there can also be ex ante distrust built up by the media we consume that tells us to look askance at anyone with views outside our adopted tribe. These can come from being in an epistemic bubble or an echo chamber.</p>
<h2 id="the-echo-chamber">The echo chamber</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-its-as-hard-to-escape-an-echo-chamber-as-it-is-to-flee-a-cult">a piece for Aeon magazine</a>, C Thi Nguyen describes an “epistemic bubble” and an “echo chamber.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An ‘epistemic bubble’ is an informational network from which relevant voices have been excluded by omission. That omission might be purposeful: we might be selectively avoiding contact with contrary views because, say, they make us uncomfortable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a crucial distinction between the two.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An ‘echo chamber’ is a social structure from which other relevant voices have been actively discredited. Where an epistemic bubble merely omits contrary views, an echo chamber brings its members to actively distrust outsiders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When even friends or family members impugn your honesty, despite all evidence that you are a credible source of information, you can infer that perhaps they are living in an echo chamber.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s a basic check: does a community’s belief system actively undermine the trustworthiness of any outsiders who don’t subscribe to its central dogmas? Then it’s probably an echo chamber.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hesitate to use the phrase “drinking the Kool-Aid” because of its dark origins, but it’s a colloquialism that everyone in English-speaking Western culture understands. People inside these echo chambers form their opinions before all the available evidence is present, based on what their media has fed them, and then, post hoc, come up with arguments on which to base their positions. Intuition drives the emotion, and the rational mind follows. They are fed by outlets like Twitter, which serve to amplify confirmation bias and algorithmically create and sustain echo chambers.</p>
<p>Jonathan Haidt (whose book I just finished), starts <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369">his latest piece for the Atlantic</a> by invoking the biblical story of the Tower of Babel. The story comes from the first book of the Bible, <em>Genesis</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scattering of the people who built the tower and the confusion of their language so that they could no longer communicate has striking parallels to modern America. Haidt makes the connection for us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Babel is not a story about tribalism; it’s a story about the fragmentation of everything. It’s about the shattering of all that had seemed solid, the scattering of people who had been a community. It’s a metaphor for what is happening not only <em>between</em> red and blue, but within the left and within the right, as well as within universities, companies, professional associations, museums, and even families.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to detail the ways in which our society has broken down and fractured, hastened by the rise of social media. The piece dives into viral dynamics. It explains how tweaks such as the Facebook like and, more powerfully, the Twitter retweet, served to germinate online mobs and the behavior that accompanies mob mentality. Haidt calls this a stupefaction process, indicating that it inhibits clear thinking. As the quote above states, this doesn’t just happen between an “in group” and an “out group,” it happens within groups (both on the left and the right).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can see the stupefaction process most clearly when a person on the left merely points to research that questions or contradicts a favored belief among progressive activists. Someone on Twitter will find a way to associate the dissenter with racism, and others will pile on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve seen this play out in real life, even when the topic of discussion has nothing to do with race, and it’s not pretty. Ideas and people are shut down, cursed by an epithet with which almost no one wants to associate. The term “demonize” becomes appropriate, and its etymology tells us all we need to know about the severity of that characterization.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t talk a lot about actual demons, these days. However, Alan Jacobs <a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/something-happened-by-us-a-demonology">writes about being absorbed into the demonic realm</a> by powers beyond our control. The ability to escape this realm starts with recognition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, as it happens, I am myself a Christian, but I do not write here to issue an altar call, an invitation to be saved by Jesus. Rather, I merely wish you, dear reader, to consider the possibility that when a tweet provokes you to wrath, or an Instagram post makes you envious, or some online article sends you to another and yet another in an endless chain of what St. Augustine called curiositas — his favorite example is the gravitational pull on all passers-by of a dead body on the side of the road — you are dealing with powers greater than yours. Your small self and your puny will are overwhelmed by the Cosmic Rulers, the Principalities and Powers. They oppress or possess you, and they can neither be deflected nor, by the mere exercise of will, overcome. Any freedom from what torments us begins with a proper demonology. Later we may proceed to exorcism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once we recognize how these urges toward animosity are creeping over us, we can begin to act. In the case of social media, action may mean reworking your method of engagement. You could refine the list of people you follow. You might realize abstinence is the only way you can properly shape your experience. Whatever may bring down the temperature and ill will towards others is advisable. Then you can begin to see the humanity in even those with whom you disagree.</p>

<h2 id="no-one-is-an-island">No one is an island</h2>
<p>While I believe that self-care is important, I also hold strongly to the belief that human flourishing is a collective enterprise. As John Donne said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No man is an island,</p>
<p>Entire of itself;</p>
<p>Every man is a piece of the continent,</p>
<p>A part of the main</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ignore the gendered language, as this is man in the universal sense. No one is an island, merely buffered against the waves that others make in the ocean. We are, in fact, connected with others in a way that protects us against the tempests that rage and threaten to destroy. John Donne was an English writer and cleric, but his metaphor works well with the composition of the United States. In the continent that Donne uses as an illustration, we are states that are federalized, all claiming our own identities, but coming together in overarching principles and common goals. We share topology and natural features like rivers and mountains that span across the lines that divide us one from another.</p>
<p>I would write that, unless you are living alone in the woods, your connections matter. However, even Thoreau, who staked his claim alone beside Walden Pond, went back to civilization to work and have his mom do his laundry. We need our neighbors and the connections we have to each other. Our species cannot survive without functional reciprocity and mutual growth. It&rsquo;s past time we started being more careful about how we engage in the activities that undermine relationships. Let&rsquo;s set new standards for ourselves and our conduct, knowing that together we can benefit each other. Rather than contracting, and sealing ourselves in our chambers, we can expand one another, broadening our horizons.</p>

<p>People tend to think of Morrissey as an overwrought melancholic (and not without some reason). I&rsquo;ve seen multiple late-night talk show hosts and comedians poke fun at his persona, satirizing the sadness of his music. It’s not all rainy days and Mondays in Morrissey’s catalog, though. “Now My Heart Is Full” represents a period in his life where the Mozzer actually became content. He had moved to the sunshine of L.A. and away from the gray skies of London. Life was bright, settled and even domestic.</p>
<p>Some of the lines in the song still sound comically morose.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> As the chorus of “now my heart is full” bears witness, though, the overall message of the song is one of hope. It contains the sentiment of a gentle satisfaction in the midst of the little indignities of life.</p>
<p>Take that, Jimmy Kimmel.</p>

			 <p>With no formal announcement (whoops), Wordpress.com changed their pricing significantly, removing the paid tiers for personal blogging and leaving nothing in between the free plan and the $180 Business plan. I&rsquo;ve often thought that Wordpress doesn&rsquo;t want to be in the business of personal blogging. Before they recently made the switch to block-based themes, most of their newer themes on Wordpress.com were geared towards businesses. It was clear from the descriptions of the themes and the static homepages advertising businesses that they weren&rsquo;t built with blogging in mind.</p>
<p>As Manton Reece points out, this move makes Micro.blog an even better value proposition at $5 a month or $50 a year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another reason you may want to think about blogging on Micro.blog is the fact that Elon Musk is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/04/1090789822/elon-musk-twitter-stock-largest-shareholder">now the largest shareholder of Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Given that he has criticized the platform for free speech and is a heavy and popular user, it is unlikely that Musk is buying Twitter stock as a passive investment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter,&rdquo; Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said in a client note early Monday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a soon-to-be-former Twitter shareholder, I can state that this news is not comforting.</p>
<p>Last week, Twitter <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/599051-twitter-suspends-babylon-bee-for-misgendering-rachel-levine/">banned the conservative satirical site The Babylon Bee</a> for what it termed “hate speech.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Specifically, the “satire” involved misgendering U.S. Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine as a man. I’m not sure what’s satirical about that, but it seems cruel and certainly not at all funny. As a sign of the coming apocalypse, <a href="https://babylonbee.com/podcast/basic/276">Elon Musk was interviewed by the Babylon Bee</a> in December 2021. Is it possible that this ban was the act which spurred Musk into thinking of buying into Twitter to change its direction?</p>
<p>These changes to the biggest blogging and microblogging platforms, respectively, should give people pause. Now might be the right time to switch platforms to one like Micro.blog, where you can create long and short-form content. M.b. has a reasonable pricing structure, and you own your blog and possibly domain, with plenty of export options if you decide to move it elsewhere.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I’m deliberately leaving out the word “Christian,” which the Babylon Bee uses to self-describe, because there is nothing Christian about their typical mode of discourse.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This cover of a Paul Simon song by The Bangles achieved more popularity than the original. The clips show the band fake playing live in front of walls of tube TV’s setup to look futuristic, interspersed with scenes from the film <em>Less Than Zero</em>. Most of the movie clips involve Andrew McCarthy and Jamie Gertz making out, though we do get to see Robert Downey Jr. and his cocaine-fueled antics. For a while there, it looked like Downey Jr. would end up like his character Julien in the movie. Thank goodness he got clean and flipped the script.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/501301/12-surprising-facts-about-less-zero">this post on Mental Floss</a> about <em>Less Than Zero</em>, the author of the book which became the movie, Brad Easton Ellis, estimates if the book were written today, it would be about 20 pages long.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ellis thinks the advent of cell phones would make the book “20 pages long” today. “There’s a long stretch in the book where Clay is driving around looking for Julian, stopping off at friends’ houses to use their phones,” he said in an interview with The Paris Review. “He even stops in at a McDonald’s to use a pay phone. But people can find each other very easily now. A single text—‘Dude, where the f–k are you? I want my money’—would take care of three-fourths of the action in the book.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guitarist Vicki Peterson had a tough time adapting the riff from the original song, since it was played on a 12-string acoustic. She had to “rock it up” for The Bangles version.</p>
<p>“Hazy Shade of Winter” was also featured on the Netflix series <em>Stranger Things</em>, episode 2, just as the credits started to roll.</p>

<p>When her parents were born, segregation was lawful in America, and here was a Black woman of unquestioned qualifications nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court, and against that heroic background, Senators Cruz, Cotton, Hawley, Graham, and Cornyn performed shameless acts in broad daylight before millions of people. These men should not be allowed to eat in public restaurants. They should go to the drive-up window and eat in the parking lot.</p>

			 <p>Ernie from Tedium has a piece on the new Asahi Linux alpha build for M1 Macs. Though I&rsquo;m unkikely to try yet another Linux distro in the near future, it is interesting to see this development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the weekend, something really awesome happened. An official distro of Linux came to Apple Silicon. And honestly, it’s extremely impressive, a joy to use (even if there are a whole bunch of gaps in the production, a number of to-come features that will limit its usefulness for the time being), and … honestly, everything that MacOS is not. It’s inspiring, and reflects a culture in which people are willing to try new things, and in which they succeed at trying out those new things just because there was enough public support for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m intruiged to find out what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;everything MacOS is not&rdquo; but the piece doesn&rsquo;t really flesh that out so much as it explores the history of Linux on ARM processors.</p>

<p>The day before President’s Day, I went to church for the first time since last summer. I’ve been watching online, well, religiously, since then, but it was a rare treat to go in and see friends and hear music being played live. Vivaldi on violin with our new sound system (which was desperately needed) alone was worth the trip. We had a congregational meeting afterward, so my stomach was starting to get into growling mode by the time I got home. I was making myself lunch while my youngest was playing a game online with his friends. He kept yelling something like, “get him with the crucifix!” From what I could understand, he was using a crucifix to protect his in-game character from hordes of evil spirits.</p>
<p>I had gone to church alone, and my wife and youngest had gone to my in-law’s apartment to do some things for them, as is their routine every Sunday. When I heard my son yelling about the crucifix, it occurred to me that I’d rather have him in church with me. At least there he could be learning about the True Cross, rather than at home playing video games where the cross is merely a weapon to ward off monsters. I recently picked up Skye Jethani’s book, <em>What If Jesus Was Serious</em>, and had started reading it. Jethani describes the book as a devotional for people who hate devotionals. There were several retweets from Jethani’s Twitter account that were posted by people reading the book with their kids. What I had read of the book seemed a little over the level of a nine-year-old, but that can be mitigated by proper explanation of the concepts while reading. For instance, Chapter 2 focused on comparing ourselves to others when using social media. My son is a bit young for social media. However, the chapter presented us with an opportunity to talk about comparing ourselves to others and how God sees value in even those that people overlook.</p>
<h2 id="tweeting-in-public">Tweeting in public</h2>
<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/mineinmono/status/1495464570584018948?s=21">tweeted about my resolution</a> and tagged the author in the tweet. He retweeted my post, and it picked up some decent traction, ending up with over 60 likes, including from Michael Wear, former president Obama’s religion advisor. For some time, I kept my tweets protected because of the <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/the-social-media-morass/">fighting on Twitter,</a> but I recently changed the setting back to public. I’ve missed being able to respond to the tweets of those who don’t follow me (you wouldn’t believe how many people fit into that category, despite my occasional witticisms). It feels good to be able to tag someone again when I want to voice support for their work.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2022/7a8e2b8cbb.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now I’ve got a public statement to hold me accountable to my goal. So far, we&rsquo;ve been sticking to the routine. I&rsquo;m hoping we can both get something out of it.</p>

<p>I know, I know, I just wrote about Brothertiger covers of 80s tunes last week in the newsletter. I have to tell you, though, that when I saw Brothertiger had covered brother/sister duo Sophie and Peter Johnston’s “Torn Open,” one of my favorite songs, I was more than pleasantly surprised. While going through my New Music playlist from Apple Music on Friday, like I usually do, I spotted the familiar song title. I literally got goosebumps before I even heard the track.</p>
<p>When I did listen to the song, I marveled out how <em>complete</em> it is. The cover thoroughly captures the brilliance of the original. Enlisting Yvette Young from the band COVET to cover the vocal parts from Sophie Johnston (which take up the majority of the song) just worked. The verses stop just short of being cloying, and the chorus soars. The vocals from frontman and Brothertiger himself, John Jagos, mainly serve to supplement Young’s. Jagos does a fantastic job mimicking the synth sound from the original track. This cover is a sophisti-pop master work.</p>

<p>The clip of Stephen Colbert expressing some basics about his faith is making the rounds (especially on Twitter). Tim Keller is an evangelical pastor who saw a potent witness on a popular talk show.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I guess I shouldn’t be surprised about the negative comments the clip has received, in addition to the praise of popular religious figures, but it’s still disappointing to see them. What Colbert did was obviously not meant to be a full-fledged statement of faith, but rather a snapshot into how faith is integrated into his life. Still, people are commenting about what it left out. They say he didn’t use the opportunity to share the gospel, for example. Commenting on what was left out is like playing gotcha with a tweet, though. You can always find things about a complex religion like Christianity that are left out of a 280 character tweet or a 2-minute sound bit from a talk show. Colbert hosts a mainstream, secular show, not a catechism. It is a beautiful thing that he shared his faith in a way that may actually make people who aren’t Christians curious. His witness being contextualized in a way that secular people can understand doesn’t mean it’s watered down or compromised. It means he is speaking to, and understands, his audience. <a href="https://www.holypost.com/post/episode-495-the-false-gospel-of-democracy-with-robert-tracy-mckenzie">Kaitlyn Schiess commented</a> on the <em>Holy Post</em> podcast that the kind of fundamentalist thought pattern that opposes contextualization shows, “the poverty of the way we think about evangelism.” She recounted how, when she was a kid, she thought she had to annoy people with her faith to be witnessing properly.</p>
<p>The reason Colbert’s guest, Dua Lipa, asked him about his faith was because people notice that Colbert is open about his beliefs. He isn’t hiding his light under a bushel, as it were. He’s open to talking about the weight of eternity on a late-night show on a major network. How often do you see that?</p>

			 <p>Freddie deBoer wrote some thoughts after being told a book was &ldquo;taken down&rdquo; on Twitter. In this sense, &ldquo;taken down&rdquo; seems to colloquially mean something like &ldquo;entirely refuted.&rdquo; deBoer takes a stance that is not expressed often enough: Something like a book refutation is not possible within a limited medium like Twitter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing as a damning review of a book in tweet form. Such a thing is beyond the affordances of the medium. A longform book review can do more, but has limits of its own. A book review can be cutting, if it’s rigorous enough - and yes, a certain length is a prerequisite for rigor. A book review can be informative and humorous and generative and entertainingly mean. I write some myself and hope to achieve such goals. But no review alone can rebut an argument expressed over hundreds of words. It might be better, or at least easier, if it were so. But we live in a world of irreducible complexity, and our efforts to wrestle it into digestible chunks to match diminishing attention spans - well, that last part is exactly the contentious issue at hand - don’t magically make life simple enough to understand through maxims or fortune cookies or tweets. It doesn’t work that way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wish more people understood the constraints of a platform like Twitter.</p>

			 <p>Jason Fried of Basecamp on the <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/the-presence-prison-69608e0f">decision they made to remove presence indicators from the app</a>. Where is someone on your work team at any given time? His response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of the time, it just doesn’t matter. What matters is letting people design their own schedule around when they can do their best work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not nearly as hard as it sounds. But it does require a shift in mindset. Away from “I have to call Jeff into a meeting now to get his take on this new feature idea” to “I’ll write up my feature idea for Jeff to check-out whenever he has some free time, and then, maybe, we can have a chat about it live later, if needed”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basecamp has a geographically distributed team, so they have had ample opportunity to learn about working asynchronously. They’ve found that the expectation of asynchronous communication, in the absence of a presence indicator, has brought more calm.</p>
<p>I understand where Fried is coming from, but I also know from my own experience that it can be helpful to know, for instance, if your boss is in a meeting or not. I try to be considerate of other&rsquo;s time, and that&rsquo;s why I find myself waiting for a green indicator before reaching out to someone. Could I schedule a meeting every time I want to talk with someone? Sure, but sometimes it helps to have a little flexibility to converse outside of the constraints of a calendar invite.</p>
<p>In other words, I get both sides of the debate. I think what&rsquo;s most important is that people respect your presence preferences, whatever tool you use.</p>

			 <p>From Ross Douthat, an attempt to fuse together the themes of his two books, <em>The Deep Places</em> and <em>The Decadent Society</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both decadence and chronic ailments cut against the human tendency to imagine a crisis as something that either leads to some kind of fatal endgame quickly or else resolves itself and goes away. Being sick for a long period of time has a baffling effect on friends and family and acquaintances, not because they’re unsympathetic or unwilling to help, but because our primary image of sickness is something that comes and quickly leaves, or comes and threatens your life and needs to be treated intensely with the highest stakes — and it’s harder to know how to respond to having something that apparently isn’t life-threatening but also doesn’t go away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can sympathize with Douthat&rsquo;s attempt to draw parallels here. I certainly understand where he is coming from with regards to how people respond to chronic illness. Most people have difficulty understanding how to deal with illness that doesn&rsquo;t go away with some modern treatment option or, on the flip side, doesn&rsquo;t leave you dead. Many times, if people don&rsquo;t hear from you, they assume you are better. Similarly, I suppose, unless people are raising an alarm, a decadent society is thought of as getting better, as well.</p>

<pre><code>⚠️ Warning: This post contains spoilers for The Book Of Boba Fett. 
</code></pre>
<p>Matt Poppe typically reviews the new Star Wars and Marvel shows for Christ and Pop Culture. He&rsquo;s now onto <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em>, though not reviewing every episode, as he has done with previous shows. <a href="https://christandpopculture.com/the-book-of-boba-fett-recap-whos-the-boss-episodes-1-2/">So far, he hasn&rsquo;t been impressed</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that’s because any guy who comes into town and thinks he’ll get it right where everyone else got it wrong tends to either fail miserably or become a weird, psycho cult leader. Whatever the outcome, this isn’t the type of person onto whom I want to project my hopes and cares as I’m munching down Little Caesars on the couch with the rest of the Poppe fam. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get where Poppe is coming from, but I have also enjoyed the series more than he has. Unlike Poppe, I can see a legitimate character arc for Boba Fett that not only makes sense, but can make for compelling TV. To leave Boba Fett where he was when we saw him in the original trilogy would be doing the character a disservice and wouldn&rsquo;t be a good follow-up to <em>The Mandolorian</em>, either.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> His entry into the canon of crime bosses promises to tell a more interesting story.</p>
<p>When we came across Boba Fett in the 1980&rsquo;s, he was a quiet loner, who as Poppe points out, wasn&rsquo;t a boss. For him to become a boss, or even to have the desire to become one, he has to undergo a transformation. <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> goes to great lengths to show us the steps in that transformation. First, he is ravaged by the Sarlacc, and very near to death, saved only by his protective beskar armor. When he escapes the bowels of the monster, unconscious in the middle of the unforgivingly arid Dune Sea, he loses that armor to itinerant Jawas, and we witness his rebirth, left almost as naked as he came into the world.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> The symbolism is easy to detect. When he is rescued/captured by a group of Tuskens, he begins to relearn how to live and even how to fight. We know all of this because the physical scars left by his experience leave him dependent on a bacta tank for healing and while he is in the tank, he has flashbacks of the past.</p>
<p>Fett&rsquo;s life with the Tuskens is anything but easy, as he gradually proves himself to a nomadic people hardened and distrusting from the harsh desert sands. As he builds himself up, he both learns from, and teaches the Tuskens. We witness a cultural exchange, and understand that the Tuskens have as much to offer Fett, as he, a man who has seen the far reaches of the galaxy and dealt with some of the most powerful people in it, has to offer them. What he has to give them, though, is not what we would expect from the Boba Fett of Empire Strikes Back. Sure, he&rsquo;s cunning, and his bravery scores him an early victory over a desert monster that impresses the Tusken tribe. As the days spent with the tribe wear on, though, he proves himself to be a masterful tactician and negotiator. As such, he becomes a de facto leader within the Tusken tribe. By the time he seems to have rid the sand people of two different groups of tormentors, he is well entrenched in the group.</p>
<p>You begin to see why Boba Fett now wants to lead rather than taking orders. The new situations he has lived through, and the experiences with which he has been gifted mark a different path for him. By the time he has gone full <em>Dances With Wolves</em> as part of the Tusken tribe, it&rsquo;s hard to believe he will ever leave. As viewers, though, we know that he moves on to become (or attempt to become) the crime boss we see in early scenes from the show. Fett&rsquo;s growth as character during his period in the Dune Sea not only makes him sympathetic, but also does something that no one watching <em>A New Hope</em> in 1977 thought would be possible: it humanizes the sand people that tried to kill Luke in that movie. The journey is a worthwhile story.</p>
<p>My main disappointment with the show is the killing off of the entire Tusken tribe early on in the season. The scenes set after Fett takes over Jabba&rsquo;s crime syndicate (what&rsquo;s left of it) are not as impactful as those set in the past with the Tuskens. However, future events have shown that was necessary to set Boba Fett on his current course. Boba Fett himself even admits he would have stayed with the Tuskens had they not been wiped out by a rival group. We know there is more in store for the once loner bounty hunter. I&rsquo;m waiting for the rest of the show to catch up to the quality of the flashbacks with the Tusken raiders, but I&rsquo;m pretty confident that it will. Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau have earned that trust, and it will be interesting to see where they take things in upcoming episodes.</p>

			 <p>Jason Morehead wrote a <a href="https://opuszine.us/reviews/2025-world-enslaved-virus-wesely-bros-2021">fair and even-handed review</a> of <em>2025: The World Enslaved By A Virus</em>, the <em>Plan 9 From Outer Space</em> of Christian virus conspiracy movies. I appreciate the approach because, while I initially enjoyed seeing the tweets poking fun at this low-budget amateur production, I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s the appropriate reaction. My teenage son watched it for a larf with his friends.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
There&rsquo;s a point at which you are laughing at something and you have a moment of self-realization that causes you to pause. For me, that pause happened when my son pointed out that the ending credits gave thanks to Jesus Christ as the second credit and started cackling. I just didn&rsquo;t see where the humor was, and it seemed like laughing at something people created in earnest just for the sake of making ourselves feel superior to them.</p>

<p>Yumi Zouma has a new full-length, <em>Present Tense</em>, coming out March 18th on Polyvinyl. As is the fashion now, they are releasing singles before the album drops, and &ldquo;In The Eyes Of Our Love&rdquo; is the third such single from the upcoming record. For this song, Yumi Zouma ditches their normally breezy, understated yet catchy, &ldquo;this band could only come from New Zealand&rdquo; sound. It comes across as something more like traditional indie pop a la The Pains of Being Pure At Heart. For reference, check out the Pains &ldquo;Summer Of Dreams,&rdquo; a b-side from their <em>Days Of Abandon</em> LP, or really, many of their other tracks. Yumi Zouma calls this the introduction to the <em>Present Tense</em> era, so it&rsquo;s evident that their change in sound is intentional.</p>
<p>The video takes as it&rsquo;s subject three women who enter an initially locked hotel room to, I guess, party? At times fearful, at times confused and then celebratory, the women soak in the mystery of this strange hotel room. All of this could be an allegory for getting out of your comfort zone to enjoy life&rsquo;s unexpected surprises, but then I may be reaching. It could be an acid trip. At any rate, enjoy the song and the video.</p>

			 <p>Sometimes, I feel like I need to stop ruminating on the &ldquo;deep cleavages in American society,&rdquo; as <a href="https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/articles/2021/12/democracy-talks-strengthening-american-democracy-with-religious-freedom.html">this piece</a> from the Bush Institute refers to them. I wonder if it would be helpful to remember the turbulence of the sixties, just to have some frame of reference for comparison, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be doing much good for my mom&rsquo;s outlook. She&rsquo;s just as exasperated with our current climate as the rest of us.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2022/b8ff28775e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>While he doesn&rsquo;t offer much in the way of solutions, David Brooks presents the problems in a clear light, in this appropriately frighteningly titled piece <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/opinion/america-falling-apart.html">America is Falling Apart at the Seams</a>. He talks about the anger, the selfishness, the violence and the despair that are increasing in measurable ways. Perhaps most of us have heard this too much, lately. I wouldn&rsquo;t be bringing this up, though, if I wasn&rsquo;t comforted by reading an alternate perspective. There are actually those who, despite frustration, are trying to create a more virtuous cycle in a fractured environment.</p>
<p>Jamie Santa Cruz <a href="https://www.plough.com/en/topics/life/relationships/when-masking-and-vaxxing-threaten-a-friendship">writes for Plough magazine</a> about how she came to terms with the different perspectives of her friends on virus prevention and maintained close relationships that were threatened by strain. She relates the difficulty of reconciling herself to the beliefs of one of her friends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maddening, this gap between us. Symbolic of many other gaps between her and me – on politics, on faith, and on all things touched by those two. Gaps that didn’t exist last time I saw her but that have become far more obvious these last two fraught years.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s hard for me to justify bending to the consciences of people who object so strenuously to basic public health measures. Should I submit my moral scruples to hers? But my friendship with Eliza goes back almost twenty years, and it has run deep. I didn’t really want to throw it out and suffer yet another Covid loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So many prize being right over relationships.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Ultimately, Santa Cruz chose a different path while on a vacation. She was to meet up with her old friend during her travels. When her friend &ldquo;Eliza&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t want to go caving in a place they required masks, she gave in and agreed to meet at alternate location. It was not without resentment that she changed plans, though. Then, Santa Cruz came down with Covid and Eliza was there to take care of her needs, saying nothing of the irony that her cautious friend was the one who ended up getting sick. She picked up groceries and refused to be reimbursed. Santa Cruz spent the rest of her vacation thinking about her friend&rsquo;s generosity.</p>
<p>The Covid story doesn&rsquo;t end at the kind deeds done by Eliza, though. After her own bought with Covid, Santa Cruz had another friend who was immunocompromised yet still refused to get the Covid vaccine contract the virus. Her first reaction was feeling like her friend had made her bed and needed to lie in it, but then she remembered how she was treated when she was sick and decided instead of gloating or frustration, she was going to take the giving path. She asked her friend if she could get groceries to help out. There, in the midst of deep divisions, was a way to pay it forward.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2022/01/17/the-tools-dont.html">The Tools Don&#39;t Matter?</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2022/01/17/the-tools-dont.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-01-17 20:00:00 -0400">Jan 17, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard it frequently said that the tools you use don&rsquo;t matter. That people who are constantly changing their working setups are just fiddling. It&rsquo;s an easy thought to entertain. I&rsquo;ve seen many an instance where people spend more time <em>tweaking</em> their tools instead of <em>using</em> them. However, there&rsquo;s some evidence that optimizing and changing our tools can actually help us accomplish more.</p>
<p>Eleanor Konik <a href="https://eleanorkonik.com/obsidian-replaced-games-now-prolific/">writes convincingly</a> about how Obsidian replaced video games and helped her publish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now and then I feel self-conscious about being so active in the community Discord because of stuff I see cross my dash periodically about “productivity porn” or about hoe “tools don’t matter” or whatever, and then I realize that no, actually, I’m genuinely — objectively, demonstrably — doing more things I love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t believe that the systems you employ can help you to get work done, Konik has plenty of her own stats to back up her claim. If you watch one of her <a href="https://eleanorkonik.com/obsidian-for-writing/">demo videos of how she uses Obsidian</a>, it&rsquo;s rather amazing the system she has put together and how it enables her to string together bits of knowledge.</p>
<p>Sometimes, simply switching tools can actually make us more productive, at least for a time, simply due to the &ldquo;novelty effect.&rdquo; Clive Thompson <a href="https://clivethompson.medium.com/why-switching-to-a-different-word-processor-can-kickstart-your-writing-10329df7a300">discusses this in a blog post</a>, with a focus on how switching word processors enabled him to get unstuck in order to write and edit more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is what’s so interesting about the novelty effect: It almost doesn’t matter what type of change you make to your work environment — just so long as you make a change. So long as it renders your work slightly askew, you get a novelty effect. (Trivia: Because the discovery was made at the Hawthorne factory, it’s also sometimes called “The Hawthorne Effect”.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Hawthorne Effect&rdquo; is not actually the effect of a novel working environment on an individual. Thompson is right in his description of the experiment with lighting changes that caused increased productivity. It wasn&rsquo;t the changes that caused the effect, though, but the understanding the participants had that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">they were being observed</a>. People under observation tend to modify their behaviors based on their interpretation of the situation. Nevertheless, Thompson&rsquo;s anecdotal evidence is fairly convincing in suggesting that changing tools can boost our output. I have seen this personally, as well. When I want to use a new tool, I devote more time and energy into exploring it. As long as I maintain that excitement I initially have for putting the new tool through its paces, and testing its features, I am motivated to put in more effort and even creativity.</p>
<p>I am still <a href="https://blog.frostedechoes.com/tending-to-your-digital-garden">using Obsidian</a> for notetaking and organizing my digital life. Everytime I come across a new capability, I&rsquo;m more likely to spend time in the tool. I recently discovered the power of being able to tag individual lines in a note and how that differs from tagging a whole note and it opened up new possibilities for how I track ideas. That in itself led me to spend more time exploring the app and using it to write. If I then switch to Ulysses, and setup a kanban process there for writing, like <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/josh-ginters-ulysses-setup-and-workflow/">Josh Ginter</a>, I get another burst of writing energy to go with the move.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to brush all of this aside and think, &ldquo;Hank Thoreau didn&rsquo;t need some productivity/notes/markdown app to write <em>Walden</em>.&rdquo; Of course that&rsquo;s true (though think of what Thoreau may have been able to churn out with the uncompromising simplicity of iA Writer!), but a good tool is a scaffolding to better output. It&rsquo;s not going to write the great American novel for you, but it is going to facilitate that process. The more you like your work environment, whether it&rsquo;s your office or your tools, the more productive you&rsquo;ll likely be.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Years ago, I saw <a href="https://www.henryzoo.com/">Henry Zhou</a> give a keynote speech at the  <em>All Things Open</em> conference. I left his talk with a more acute understanding of just how hard it is to maintain an open source project that has become popular. Zhou, who is a humble and giving individual, spoke about the unreasonable demands of users who would get angry if their messages didn&rsquo;t receive a response from the developer within 20 minutes. These developers are essentially volunteers, but they aren&rsquo;t given the treatment you would expect for donating their time and effort to the common good.</p>
<p>It comes as no surprise then, <a href="https://clivethompson.medium.com/why-open-source-developers-are-burning-out-1a860854884c">as Clive Thompson reports</a>, many open source developers are burning out and abandoning their projects. As he notes in his piece, open source projects were supposed to be like Amish barn raisings, where many hands make light work. For most projects, though, it hasn&rsquo;t turned like that. He cites findings presented in Nadia Eghbal&rsquo;s book <em>Working In Public</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twenty years into the open-source era, it hasn’t worked out that way. Eghbal found that only a minority of projects, perhaps 3%, resemble true barn-raisings — or “federations”, as she dubbed them — with lots and lots of contributors pitching in. (Some examples are Linux, Node, or Rust.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In contrast, the great majority of open source projects are run by tiny teams, and often only one lone person. Outside contributions are pretty minor, and limited to a tiny one-line syntatic bug fix. That’s not nothing! Those little contributions are great.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But the upshot is, those lone coders wind up doing the lion’s share of the work. “Open source inexplicably skewed from a collaborative to a solo endeavor” as Eghbal writes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thompson likens coders working on a project that suddenly gets popular to an solo entertainer who finds themselves playing to stadiums full of fans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if a developer suddenly finds themselves playing to a stadium — and swallowed up by the time-sucking demands thereof — then not getting paid can become a serious problem. There aren’t enough hours in the day. Plus, watching wildly profitable and highly-funded tech firms use their code without contributing anything back: That can just feel like a moral insult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This trend should be worrying enterprises that rely heavily on open source software. A lot of big companies are using source software in order to reduce their expenses. Once the open source components are integrated, they can sometimes be hard to extract.</p>

<p>Last week, I wrote about some musical favorites from 2021. This week, I&rsquo;m posting the video from one of my favorite songs that isn&rsquo;t from last year, but that I <em>discovered</em> last year. I think this one surfaced due to the Apple Music recommendation algorithm, which has gotten really good. I ask Siri to play a song on the diminutive but fairly powerful HomePod Mini, then, once the song is done, the device magically plays other music that I like. The hit to miss ratio is high these days, and I&rsquo;m finding out about a lot of bands that sound similar to the ones I already enjoy.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Since several music blogs that I used to follow have now become celebrity gossip sites (ahem, cough, Stereogum, Consequence), I need a sonic buddy in the form of a solid recommendation engine.</p>
<p>Geowulf&rsquo;s &ldquo;Saltwater&rdquo; sticks in my brain and produces a sort of wistfulness that&rsquo;s simultaneously sad and comforting. It evokes memories of trips to the beach, which have spanned the entirety of my life, and leaves me with a longing for another walk on the sand to sort through my thoughts. The image of letting saltwater wash over you &ldquo;even when you&rsquo;re broken,&rdquo; speaks to me physically and emotionally.</p>

			 <p>Andy Nicolaides over at the Dent urges us to take it easy on ourselves when it comes to social media. Look around the interwebs and you will find no shortage of people berating themselves up for their time spent on social media or trying to concoct ways to curb their use of those platforms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A big one is the use of Twitter. A huge amount of people are using this service multiple times a day, for various reasons. I’ve started seeing quite a few posts, or comments just as an aside in a post however, with the authors both figuratively and literally <em>apologising</em> for using the service. They beat themselves up for using it too much, or for wasting time ‘just scrolling’. I’m starting to question why that is. I mean, don’t get me wrong, if you’re leaving a dog or child to starve to death because you’re too obsessed with Twitter to feed them you’re most definitely an animal and you <em>should</em> be ashamed. If, however, you’re a hardworking individual that likes to utilise (not <em>waste</em>) your time flicking around Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, or whatever your service of choice is then you go for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Social media can be addictive and you don’t have to be Jaron Lanier to understand the ways those companies use psychological tricks to keep you coming back. However, if you can manage the urge and make reasonable use of Twitter or similar platforms, then you should give yourself a break and recognize that it’s an enjoyable activity for you.</p>

			 <p>It would be difficult to come up with a more precise and succinct description of our modern political predicament than this one by former religion advisor to Barack Obama, Michael Wear, from his new Substack newsletter. Sure, things are not exactly this simple, and there are so many dynamics at play, but at a macro level, this feels like it nails the current climate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an earlier post this year, I reiterated a basic dynamic in our social life that I am not the first to identify, but that I think generally holds: that conservatives have significant political power but feel embattled and resentful due to progressives’ cultural power, and progressives have significant cultural power, but feel embattled and resentful due to conservatives’ political power. That basic assessment requires significant explanation and caveats, but there’s a core truth to it that is helpful as you look out and try to make sense of our politics and broader public life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I like about Wear is his consistent optimism. Despite the seeming enormity of the problems that plague us now, he is always looking at how we can mitigate them. He frames problem solving in terms of developing virtues in a way that I rarely see elsewhere.</p>

			 <p>Twitter is serious about suspending the accounts of those who spread disinformation about Covid-19 or the vaccines for the virus. They have just shown, yet again, that they are willing to remove individuals from the platform, regardless of their popularity or government status. In these cases, they are enforcing terms of service that have already been set down, not being arbitrary or capricious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twitter has long banned users from sharing misinformation that could lead to harm. In rare cases, the company has permanently banned high-profile accounts, including the account of former President Donald J. Trump, over a risk of “further incitement of violence” after a mob of Trump loyalists stormed the U.S. Capitol last Jan. 6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is interesting is to see those who would label themselves as &ldquo;small government&rdquo; conservatives wanting the government to step in and prevent private companies, like Twitter, or in the case of the Parler deplatforming, Apple, Google and Amazon, from upholding their own terms of service. As I&rsquo;ve <a href="/2021/01/10/inside-the-gallery.html">written in the past</a>, I believe companies should be allowed to set and enforce their own terms.</p>

<p>This is definitely the most playful music video I&rsquo;ve seen in some time. You have Hazel English, mostly dressed like a school girl from a private prep school, goofing around in fountains, reading in the grass, and well, attending school. The song exudes a twee charm with a suitable theme about crushing on someone and following them around like a puppy dog. I love the urgency in the guitar solo that closes out the song. It’s like shaking up a bottle of soda pop (soda for those in the East Coast and pop for those in the Midwest) and then opening it up to a carbonated explosion that sends the beverage everywhere.</p>

			 <p>Christians love the part in <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> where Linus gives his speech about the true meaning of Christmas, quoting from the book of Luke. I am not exempting myself from the devotion to that scene. A few years ago, I read this passage at a Christmas Eve service at our church, and, even though it wasn’t in the translation from which I was reading, I was tempted to use the phrase, “and they were sore afraid,” just to be like Linus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the movie <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas,</em> when a frustrated Charlie Brown asks, “Isn’t there anyone who knows what Christmas is all about?” Linus, with his security blanket in hand, steps center stage and quotes <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/niv/Luke%202.8%E2%80%9314">Luke 2:8–14</a>. In the middle of his recitation, as he says, “Fear not,” he drops his blanket—the thing he clung to when afraid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing I hadn’t noticed before was the part about Linus dropping his security blanket, which his sister Lucy tried in vain many times to wrest from him, when he recites the scripture. It wasn’t until I read this passage in Our Daily Bread that I recounted that crucial part of the scene. Linus always carries that blanket to feel safe. The action has a symbolically profound implication about how we try to let go and trust in the Lord to guide us, especially during this season.</p>

<p>Austin Kleon <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2021/09/29/the-four-energies/">quotes Bill O’Hanlon</a> when he talks about the four energies for writing. The first two (the upper quadrants) being positive, the second two (the lower quadrants) are the negative energies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blissed</li>
<li>Blessed</li>
<li>Pissed</li>
<li>Dissed</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d rather be writing from the upper two quadrants, but I have to admit to be expressing myself from the “pissed” category today.</p>
<p>Much has been written about how the call to get vaccinated against Covid-19, the urge (or mandate) to wear masks, etc. are for the benefit of others as much as ourselves. How do we respect the lives and health of others while living in community? Ed Yong <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/12/i-canceled-my-birthday-party-because-omicron/621041/">recently canceled his birthday party</a> in order to keep people safe, because his birthday falls so closely to Christmas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone got sick, I know others could too. A week later, many of my friends will spend Christmas with their own families. At best, a cluster of infections at the birthday party would derail those plans, creating days of anxious quarantine or isolation, and forcing the people I love to spend time away from their loved ones. At worst, people might unknowingly carry the virus to their respective families, which might include elderly, immunocompromised, unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or otherwise vulnerable people. Being born eight days before Christmas creates almost the perfect conditions for one potential super-spreader event to set off many more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yong doesn’t worry so much about himself, but others whom he might not even know getting sick during the holidays. This is the kind of mentality that drives disease prevention. Yet, even as I praise Yong’s thinking, I think about welcoming my sister home from international living only a few days ago with a birthday party for her. She hadn’t been vaccinated. Though her vaccine status was not for lack of effort. Vaccines are harder to come by in Eastern Europe. We did what we could to mitigate the risk with vaccinations of those in the US, but ultimately deferred total caution for fellowship. In our defense, almost everyone present is planning to be together in that grouping throughout the holidays.</p>
<p>Most people are navigating these tough decisions right now. However, it feels like those that aren’t getting vaccinated aren’t even trying to choose. At least in the US, they are simply giving up on doing what is easy and meeting that low bar to help ensure the continuing health of others. This became real for us this week when the unvaccinated coworker that is in closest proximity to my brother at the bank in which he works tested positive for Covid. We are now looking at the possible outcome of my brother not being able to attend the Christmas celebration with relatives that have come from the other side of the country and the world to be a part of. I’m not sure of <em>why</em> his coworker isn’t vaccinated, but I suspect the reason isn’t what most would think of as legitimate. Hopefully, testing will show my brother is negative.</p>
<p>For Christians, caring for others is a matter of faith and conscience. The particulars are summed up well in <a href="https://www.catalystresources.org/christians-and-covid/">this relatively short piece</a> from Catalyst magazine, in which Joel B. Green profiles the position of the eminent bioethicist D. Garett Jones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though he doesn’t draw attention to the absence from Scripture of the modern category of “human rights,” Jones does observe that “serving one another and laying down one’s life (rights) for others” is central to the Christian ethos. He draws the inescapable corollaries regarding caring for one’s neighbor, serving “the other,” for example, through donning face masks, practicing social distancing, and participating in efforts to vaccinate everyone, including oneself, who is eligible. “This is Christian social responsibility in practice.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The piece goes on to explain Protestant Reformer Martin Luther’s stance on taking steps for disease prevention to ensure the health of self and neighbor. Similar statements have been echoed across other Christian traditions. It’s pretty clear where the faithful should stand on these issues.</p>
<p>My anger has to be tempered by humility, grace and an understanding of my own actions. If I’m honest though, <em>I’m still pissed</em>.</p>

			 <p>It seems the Chinese government is starting to understand that a political system with no real values is not healthy for people. The citizens of the country are increasingly developing a sort of nihilistic tendency. “Among the online youth, for example, ‘sang culture’ (roughly the equivalent of “doomerism” in the West) has proliferated.”</p>
<p>To combat a lack of spirituality in their culture, the Communist party is turning to Marx to inspire. From <em>People’s Daily</em>, the flagship newspaper of the Chinese Communist party:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recalling the “warmth” he still feels after finishing this study of Marx, a “warmth [that] comes from spiritual excitement, spiritual joy,” the reviewer concludes with an account of the “deep sense of inner satisfaction and happiness” he has gained, before declaring himself, with the cry of a convert, “a Marxist believer!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The piece notes that these pronouncements sound more like they come from mid-2000’s American Evangelical Christians than Chinese Communists. The party recognizes, though, that they need to combat the malaise that their culture has engendered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This has kicked off a scramble, led by top Party political theorist Wang Huning, to “create core values” to fill this uncomfortably God-shaped societal hole with the comforts of a synthetic ideological alternative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It remains to be seen if the Chinese can be spiritually fulfilled by Marxist theory, which is still purely materialist.</p>

I really like the balance that she is able to strike between a fascination for work that requires a computer, and being able to extract time where she is not using a device.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What I spend the majority of my time doing:</strong> Sitting in front of my computer. Whether it’s learning, creating, connecting with other curious minds&hellip; I sometimes think it’s too much screen time, but there is such joy coming through this window on the world!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On her reading habit becoming a ritual:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another thing that’s helped me move from routine to ritual is that starting last year, I’ve followed a strict rule of no electronic devices in my bedroom. It’s probably one of the simplest and best lifestyle changes I’ve made. It sounds obvious but not having devices in my room makes me sleep earlier, and better. I wake up with more energy and I’m more productive and creative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While most of what she does involves screen time, she also puts hard boundaries around those activities to make time for other enrichment. I would find the part about putting away electronic devices in my bedroom pretty difficult. I wouldn’t give up my Kobo, of course, but even when you have an iPad, that lean back device form factor makes it too easy to use when supine. The closest thing I’ve got to her resolve is to set downtime to 9:30pm, but even that is too easy to break by putting in my screen time code.</p>

			 <p>Matt Birchler writes in <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/photography-needs-to-be-fun/">Photography Needs to be Fun</a> about how the new Glass photography network feels a bit too stilted and more like Unsplash than Instagram.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Twitter and instagram are teeming with pros, amateurs, and everyone else, and they’re just more rich photography experiences for me. Social networks have cultures that form around them, and my feeling is that the culture in Glass is way too buttoned up and monolithic. I want photography to be diverse and fun, and the monolithic feeds I see in Glass don’t check either of those boxes for me now.</p>

			 <p>Kevin Crowley was caught in a crowd during a trampling incident that killed 94 people. He was severely traumatized. He tried therapy to help him cope, but it was initially to no avail.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But two years ago he spotted a poster advertising therapy over the internet, and he decided to give it another go. After dozens of regular sessions in which he and his therapist talked via text message, Cowley, now 49, is at last recovering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder. “It’s amazing how a few words can change a life,” says Andrew Blackwell, chief scientific officer at <a href="https://www.iesogroup.com/">Ieso</a>, the UK-based mental health clinic treating Cowley.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s crucial is delivering the right words at the right time. Blackwell and his colleagues at Ieso are pioneering a new approach to mental-health care in which the language used in therapy sessions is analyzed by an AI. The idea is to use <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/31/1005876/natural-language-processing-evaluation-ai-opinion/">natural-language processing</a> (NLP) to identify which parts of a conversation between therapist and client—which types of utterance and exchange—seem to be most effective at treating different disorders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NLP being used would operate something like sentiment analysis. The results from these findings could open up the door to much more effective, evidence based protocols and standards within psychotherapy. This type of research and rigor is crucial right now, when mental health issues are on the rise globally. As someone with a degree in psychology, I can state that I’ve never seen this type of a heavily data integrated approach to psychotherapy before and it gives me great hope for the discipline.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft’s moves seem desperate. And familiar. It is clear they don’t want you to use other browsers. They even offer to pay you to use the browser via their Microsoft Rewards program. This is not the behavior of a confident company developing a superior browser. It’s the behavior of a company openly abusing its powerful position to push people to use its inferior product, simply because it can. Do not pass Go, do not collect $200. Can you say monopoly?</p>

			 <p>Amazon employees yet again have reason to complain about their treatment from the company as it proposes reinstating a ban on worker’s cell phones in its warehouses. The employee perspective is that their phones can alert them to dangerous conditions, such as the tornado activity that ended up ripping apart an Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, something that they don’t trust Amazon to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The concerns about phone access highlight the deep distrust between executives who make rules focused on productivity and efficiency to gain a competitive advantage, and hourly front-line workers who often fear their safety is secondary to moving packages. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the world’s wealthiest man after Elon Musk, only fueled such feelings by spending the earlier part of Saturday celebrating a celebrity space launch by his company Blue Origin while emergency crews at the warehouse dug through rubble looking for bodies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bezos eventually sent a couple of vague tweets pledging support for the employees in Edwardsville.</p>

<p>Facebook has been outed in the US for its dishonorable practices, but what it&rsquo;s done in this country is nothing compared to the damage it has caused in other parts of the world. One the places where it has helped to create a perfect storm of violence by radicalizing users against the minority Rohingya is the country of Myanmar. The platform spread information and hate speech that cost the lives of a targeted group of people. In 2018, Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/11/myanmar-hria/">essentially admitted</a> to its role in the attacks carried out against the Muslim minority.</p>
<p>Meta (Facebook) is now facing class action lawsuits in the US and the UK for its part in amplifying the violence in Myanmar. The total damages being sought by the plaintiffs are &gt; $150 billion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To maximise engagement, Facebook does not merely fill users' News Feeds with disproportionate amounts of hate speech and misinformation; it employs a system of social rewards that manipulates and trains users to create such content,&rdquo; the plaintiffs wrote in the complaint.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At the core of this complaint is the realisation that Facebook was willing to trade the lives of the Rohingya people for better market penetration in a small country in Southeast Asia.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facebook is an incredibly powerful tool and, in the hands of bad actors, can be a weapon against human flourishing. Too often, Facebook has refused to accept their power and chased profits over safety. Punitive monetary damages will send a message in a language that the company can understand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Twelve special movie theaters were getting upgraded with special speakers for this music-driven film. Disney wanted to test the recording equipment and speakers in preparation for the Fantasia release, and hired Hewlett and Packard when they were still just freelancing engineers. The two entrepreneurs, exicted by the Disney deal, flipped a coin to decide the name of their new business—Hewlett won the toss, and got first billing.</p>

<p>Paul Kingsnorth kind of lost me on <a href="https://paulkingsnorth.substack.com/p/the-vaccine-moment-part-one">his anti-vaxxer rant</a> this week. Did George Washington&rsquo;s troops complain this bitterly about authoritarianism when <a href="https://www.wral.com/fact-check-did-george-washington-mandate-vaccines-for-his-army/19807935/">he had them inoculated</a> for small pox upon entering the Continental Army? My guess is that they probably didn&rsquo;t, because they were fighting to be freed from actual authoritarianism. They had stared raw state power in the face and knew what it looked like and it wasn&rsquo;t getting a jab (not this kind, anyway).</p>
<p>Kingsnorth&rsquo;s whole, long think piece is predicated on the assumption that getting the vaccine is about so much more than the vaccine itself. Going beyond the medical advice, which is hardly ever exactly perfect, and really getting at core divisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Often, in an argument, what people think they are arguing about is not the real subject of disagreement, which is deeper and often unspoken, if it is even understood. So it is here. The divisions that have opened up in society about the covid vaccines are not really about the covid vaccines at all: they are about what vaccination symbolises in this moment. What it means to be &lsquo;vaxxed&rsquo; or &lsquo;unvaxxed&rsquo;, safe or dangerous, clean or dirty, sensible or irresponsible, compliant or independent: these are questions about what it means to be a good member of society, and what society even is, and they are detonating like depth charges beneath the surface of the culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kingsnorth reveals he remains proudly unvaccinated. He works to layer meaning on top of meaning to get to his point about how dangerous a situation we are in (this article is labeled part 1, so there&rsquo;s more coming). I have to wonder about this perspective, though. What if this isn&rsquo;t encroaching authoritarianism (history of Austria and Germany aside)? What if it&rsquo;s not even particularly egregious paternalism? What if it&rsquo;s really just about getting a vaccination that gives you a better survival rate against a deadly disease? What if it&rsquo;s just about coming together to mitigate a public health crisis in the best ways that we know how?</p>

			 <p><strong>Ellane W. has <a href="https://medium.com/produclivity/a-step-by-step-guide-for-creating-your-own-delicious-slice-of-text-based-productivity-8ad4a7d8a7b5">a blog post on the capture and find methodology</a> and implementing that with Drafts + Obsidian. She uses Drafts for capture and Obsidian for find.</strong></p>
<h2 id="capture">Capture</h2>
<p>In my comparison, Drafts is better for capture than any other apps. It&rsquo;s the one tool that seems to be able to grab highlights, title and URL from a post in just about any app where you are reading (Pocket, Instapaper, Safari, etc.). You can then append that info to an existing note or create a fresh note. Drafts also excels at quickly getting in, jotting down some text and popping back out again. It has been compared to digital sticky notes and the comparison is fairly apt (with the exception of not being able to do cute little drawings). I remember reading a post from someone who setup a shortcut that, when he taps the back of his phone twice, automatically brings up a new draft page. Now that is easy capture.</p>
<h2 id="find">Find</h2>
<p>The find piece of the equation comes from Obsidian. Drafts plays nicely with Obsidian and even <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/using-obsidian-with-drafts/11221">has a guide</a> for getting setup to link the two apps. The two main actions that Ellane highlights &ldquo;append text to your daily note&rdquo; and &ldquo;create a file anywhere in your Obsidian vault.&rdquo; While Obsidian excels at storing information and becoming a <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2021/09/22/untitled.html">digital garden</a>, getting data in from other apps can be difficult, which is where Drafts well-thought-out integration comes into play.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2021/46b20eed3b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>(I have been using the Things themes in both Drafts and Obsidian and that gives me a sense of consistency when jumping between the apps.)</em></p>
<h2 id="publish">Publish</h2>
<p>The one step that is important to me that was left out of the process is the step to publish. If you want to publish directly from Obsidian, you have only two options (that I am aware of). You can publish using Obsidian&rsquo;s own publish option. Or, if you are doing more traditional blogging, you can publish to <a href="https://blot.im">Blot.im</a> by sharing an Obsidian note to Dropbox. Blot also supports wiki style links, so it is really ideal if you are using Obsidian as the hub of your model. However, if you want to publish to other blogging engines, you have a couple of options. You can post straight from Drafts, which supports most services. In that case, you just change your posting action in Drafts not to default to &ldquo;archive,&rdquo; once the post is made. You then use one of the actions to send to Obsidian and archive. In the case of a blog post, you would most likely use the action to send the note to an Obsidian folder.</p>
<p>The other way you can publish is to handoff the note to another app to take care of that piece of the process. For instance, you can share to iA Writer. If you are using Ulysses, you can hook up an external folder, which could be the one you use in Obsidian to store blog posts, and publish straight from there. The publish part of this process allows for the most flexibility and choice of tools.</p>

			 <p>I remember a time, not long ago, when we laughed at the introduction of Space Force from then-president Donald Trump. It was easy to jest, with the name that itself sounded like a parody, coming from a president that never could quite get anything real done. Of course, some of us remember &ldquo;Star Wars,&rdquo; the space missile shield that president Reagan made up to psych-out the Soviets. Decades of science fiction speculation haven’t quite turned out the way they were depicted. None of us are using jet packs to get to work and we haven’t colonized the moon or Mars. We’ve been conditioned to be skeptical about outlandish sounding initiatives involving space.</p>
<p>A lot has gone on in space in the last 50 years, though. Despite that progress, not the least of which has been the incredible proliferation of satellites that we&rsquo;ve quickly come to depend on, the last rules of engagement were set in the sixties, according to <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2021/11/ad-astra-the-coming-battle-over-space/">this cover story</a> in Harper&rsquo;s, which makes predictions about the coming battle for space.</p>
<p>The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russia-satellie-weapon/2021/11/15/0695621c-4648-11ec-973c-be864f938c72_story.html">reports on the recent destruction of one of their own satellites</a> by the Russians.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Russia’s Ministry of Defense confirmed in a statement that it “successfully conducted a test, as a result of which the inactive Russian spacecraft Tselina-D, which has been in orbit since 1982, was hit.”</p>
<p>But the ministry said the test “did not and will not post a threat to orbital stations, spacecraft and space activities.”</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Tuesday that the U.S. claim “that Russia poses risks to activities for the peaceful use of outer space is, to say the least, hypocrisy.”</p>
<p>He said it’s the Americans who have ignored proposals from Russia and China on arms regulation in space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That hardly sounds like a friendly exchange. It makes you think we may need a Space Force sooner rather than later. The risks are not all military, though. Clive Thompson <a href="https://clivethompson.medium.com/get-ready-for-the-kessler-syndrome-to-wreck-outer-space-7f29cfe62c3e">writes about</a> a prediction, called Kessler Syndrome, made over 40 years ago about orbiting debris (the kind made by the Russian strike).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Back in 1978, the astrophysicist Donald Kessler made an alarming prediction: Space junk could wreck our ability to keep satellites aloft.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Russian action created 1500 detectable pieces of debris and many more smaller pieces. With this kind of junk piling up, Thompson notes, we could end up with a planetary ring of garbage like the one depicted in Wall-E. That situation would be very dangerous for satellites because even small debris hurdling through space at high velocity can cause significant damage. If satellites were taken out, civilization could have a serious and rapid regression.</p>
<p>_It looks like it’s time to start paying sustained attention to space again. _</p>

Their “Teal Album” of takes on the classics brings me joy. I especially like how the vocals are handled on “Take On Me.”</p>
<p>The video stars Finn Wolfhard as a young Rivers Cuomo, rocking out in his living room. It’s chock full of clever 80’s nostalgia and also manages to fit in a proper homage to the animation from the original video.</p>

<p><strong>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve had three eBay ID&rsquo;s.</strong> eBay used to allow logins from a single-sign on provider at some point (though I can&rsquo;t remember which) and I used that. Then they removed that feature and I had to change my ID. I made several transactions under the new ID. Now, a few years later, eBay will no longer recognize that ID and I had to create a new one. What is the problem with a new ID, you ask?</p>
<p>New ID&rsquo;s start with a 0 rating. I didn&rsquo;t think that was such a big deal, until I started to trying to sell with it. The first offer I had on a camp stove popped up for the asking price as soon as I listed it. Needless to say, I was pleased. Once the sale occurred, the buyer messaged me that he had questions and wanted me to text him. I thought it was strange, because normally questions are asked before a purchase. However, the buyer had a good rating, so I reached out over text. He asked me about the condition of the item (it was brand new, as the listing indicated). He also wanted more pictures but there was really nothing more to give him. He said he was going to pay via PayPal, but wanted the item shipped to his cousin as a present. I was willing to ship the item wherever. Then he started asking me to buy $400 in gift cards to put in the box and that he would cover the expense plus extra for gas and hassle. Red flags were going up all over the place. I told him no and contacted eBay. They did an investigation. It turned out the legitimate account had been hacked and someone was using it to scam people.</p>
<p>The account was returned to its rightful owner and I was told that the transaction had been canceled. I had to go through and relist the item again (I was surprised eBay didn&rsquo;t do that automatically). The next time I listed the item, it went through a week without any bids, at which time eBay automatically lowered the price a bit (which is a cool feature). Almost immediately after it was lowered, I had a bid for the asking price. I accepted right away. Almost as quickly, I had a message from the buyer that he had a question and wanted me to text him. I replied that I would answer any questions over the eBay messaging system. I got another message that was the same as the first. I let a couple of days go by, and with no other word, called eBay. They told me to cancel the sale and confirmed my suspicion that scam artists were on the lookout for sellers with low ratings. I asked how I’m supposed to sell in that environment, but the support rep had no response to my question.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how people would get started selling on eBay at this point, being at the mercy of successive scammers. I’ve heard Craig’s List referred to as “Flake’s List,” so I’m not sure things are better over there. Where are people selling online these days, I wonder?</p>

			 <p>When my oldest was younger, we used to read a Berenstain Bears book about prayer. While the books about these anthropomorphic bears are designed to be simple lessons for kids, the particular angles in this book struck me deeply. The take on prayer was nuanced and mature.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2021/d87487ded2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the book <em>The Berenstain Bears Say Their Prayers</em>, Brother Bear is on the same baseball team with his devout cousin, Fred. When they face a particularly tough team with an intimidating player, Fred prays before he pitches to a hitter they refer to only as “The Beast.” To Brother’s astonishment, Fred strikes out The Beast. When brother inquires as to how he did it, Fred talks about his pre-pitch prayer. Brother tries to imitate Fred when he is up as hitter, and prays for a hit. Unfortunately for Brother, and as a blow to his faith, he strikes out. After the incident, he talks again with Fred about prayer. Fred asks what he prayed for, and Brother tells him his supplication was for a hit. When Brother asked Fred what he prayed for he reveals that he simply prayed not to be scared.</p>
<p>It’s hard to know what providence has in store and I suspect Cousin Fred is onto something. If we pray for something very specific, we are taking a chance in praying for something God doesn’t have planned for us. I believe in the power of prayer to move the heart of God. I also believe that God has a plan for our lives and that our prayers should be in alignment with His will for us. That can be hard to know, so sometimes prayers of supplication are just for strength to keep going in order to see what God has set in front of us next.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years. My son is growing up, working diligently on school projects and just went to his first rock show at a club. He doesn’t read Berenstain Bears anymore. In point of fact, sadly, <a href="https://getpocket.com/explore/item/boys-don-t-read-enough">he doesn’t read any books</a>. Perhaps more disappointing, he doesn’t seem to have internalized the lessons on prayer taught in Sunday school, confirmation class or by the anthropomorphic bears. It can be hard to get him to pray, even when he’s struggling. I wish that he could remember Cousin Fred and his example of prayer to know that it can be effective by putting us in touch with a loving God who wants us to live into the challenges set before us.</p>

			 <p><strong>Cory Doctorow has made himself an expert on digital privacy</strong>. <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/14/still-the-product/">This essay</a> is mainly about surveillance capitalism and Doctorow uses Vizio as a negative example. When he takes on the now old adage, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re not paying for the product, you&rsquo;re the product,&rdquo; his insight really resonates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the simplistic account of what many call &ldquo;surveillance capitalism,&rdquo; the original sin was swapping our attention for free content, summed up in the pithy phrase, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not paying for the product, you&rsquo;re the product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used to subscribe to the idea behind this phrase and repeated it often. It was a go to critique for the Facebook model. Unfortunately, I was never fully taking into account income inequality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Paying for the product&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t just hollow, it&rsquo;s actively harmful. Under conditions of gross inequality and high levels of debt, &ldquo;paying for the product&rdquo; excludes those who lack the means to pay from access to the digital world. If Facebook charged for access, people who couldn&rsquo;t afford it wouldn&rsquo;t dig a hole and pull the dirt in over themselves. They&rsquo;d land on a billionaire-subsidized platform – a social media version of Prageru – where moderators would delete comments that criticized corporate power. This is even worse than widely recognized issues like, &ldquo;The truth is paywalled and the lies are free.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two things really brought this issue front and center for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>The rise in popularity of the subscription model. Apps, publications and services have gone all in on this model and for many of us, there’s only so much we can pay on a recurring basis.</li>
<li>Loss in income. When your take home goes down, you start to question all of your expenses, and value the items for which you’ve already fully paid and therefore own.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m now in agreement with Doctorow. The mentality of having to pay for every product to gain the entitlement not to be exploited as “the product” has to go.</p>

			 <p><strong>Does calling our actions &ldquo;radical&rdquo; or &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; make us feel better about ourselves?</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>B.D McClay <a href="https://www.gawker.com/culture/pleasure-needs-no-politics">points out how everything we do</a> is being reframed as political.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rest is a radical act. Cooking is a revolutionary act. Joy is an act of resistance. Savoring a pleasant moment is a radical act. Excellence is an act of resistance, but so is procrastination. Being thankful is — you guessed it — a radical act. Reading is a radical act. Ted Lasso is not, itself, a radical act, but it does provide “radical optimism,” which is almost as good. These are descriptions culled from a variety of sources, from Apartment Therapy to the New York Times. The verdict is in: the most radical thing you can do is probably the thing you were going to do already.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>McClay goes on to point out that actions can have their own intrinsic rewards. You don&rsquo;t have to couch them in the language of revolution to enjoy them without guilt. The things that are typically the building blocks of our everyday lives are not, in essence, revolutionary.</p>
<p>Reading will not cause you to wind up in jail. There are still enough books being sold to assure us that reading is not a radical act and still being done by a decent percentage of the population. It may be countercultural to read instead of binging the latest Netflix series, but it&rsquo;s hardly radical.</p>
<p>The primary definition of radical from Merrium-Webster:</p>
<pre><code>Radical: very new and different from what is traditional or ordinary
</code></pre>
<h2 id="counterculture">Counterculture</h2>
<p>You are not going to become a revolutionary because you are thankful, or because you brush your teeth or savor a pleasant moment. However, in following some traditions, while they may not be radical, may be make you countercultural in contemporary Western society. In my bio for Medium, I mention &ldquo;Christianity as counterculture.&rdquo; What I&rsquo;m referring to are practices like observing the Sabbath (through rest and worship). I used to go to Trader Joe&rsquo;s on my way back from church on Sundays. A sizable number of people there were in workout gear. To say our physical health is more important to us than our spiritual health these days would be to state the obvious. Therefore, Sabbath observance, once upon a time effectively enforced by the laws of the land, is now countercultural. It&rsquo;s not radical, though. I think too many writers are missing the difference.</p>
<pre><code>Counterculture: a culture with values and mores that run counter to those of established society
</code></pre>
<h2 id="calling-actions-radical-makes-them-sound-more-noble">Calling Actions Radical Makes Them Sound More Noble</h2>
<p>I recently came across a piece for the NYT titled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/opinion/divorce-children.html">Divorce Can Be An Act of Radical Self-Love</a>. I&rsquo;ll set aside the many problems with the piece and focus on the title and premise. In many instances, divorce can be an act of self-love. You don&rsquo;t get to call something roughly half of the married population do &ldquo;radical,&rdquo; though. It may make your self-serving actions sound better intentioned than they really are, but that&rsquo;s simply a semantic trick. Articles like these are diminishing the word certainly of its usefulness and probably of its very meaning. At least when &ldquo;radical&rdquo; was slang in the eighties, it meant something was extraordinarily cool. Even then, it wasn&rsquo;t so brutishly abused as it is now.</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago, <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2021/10/12/munya-voyage-to.html">I blogged about</a> Quebec artist MUNYA and her upcoming album, <em>Voyage to Mars</em>. MUNYA just released a new track off the album, the disco-inflected “Voyage” and filmed a video to go with it. In the video, lots of construction is going on, but the viewer is never really given a total picture of what is being built. It’s almost as if she’s creating something that can never be completed. The lyrics repeated over and over in the chorus may speak something to this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All my life, all the dreams</p>
<p>I’ll never forget about you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the place of completion, there’s a sense of loss. Accompanying that sense of loss is the drive to move on. Perhaps a resignation over a relationship that’s never going to work out.</p>

<p>I had never heard of Dave Depper before this week, but I’m glad to make his musical acquantance via a new cover of Air’s <em>Moon Safari</em> album.</p>
<p>After hearing the announcement of his upcoming album via Turntable Kitchen (which I referred to as “seemingly abandoned” <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2021/10/15/jenn-champion-love.html">less than a month ago</a>), I checked out his back catalog. Although he plays keyboards in Death Cab For Cutie, you would be hard to find the connection in most of his music.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The track I’ve selected to share, “Lonely With You,” is a modern R&amp;B indie slow jam with&hellip; pedal steel. The novelty gives me a dopamine rush.</p>

			 <p>On the post rock blog, <em>A Closer Listen</em>, Richard Allen <a href="https://acloserlisten.com/2021/11/05/hammock-elsewhere/">reviews the new Hammock album</a>, <em>Elsewhere</em>. I&rsquo;m looking forward to giving the album an intentional listen, when I have a chance. The songs are shorter, relative to those on other Hammock releases, so hopefully finding the time to give them attention should be less difficult. Allen calls out an excerpt from the liner notes on how the music approaches life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But as Wyatt Marshall writes in the liner notes, the duo encourages listeners to “live their lives” in whatever condition, battered or blessed, they may be.  Hammock neither shies from the pain of the world nor offers a simple solution.  They imply that the ways out may include forward, sideways, or through, but never backward or standing still.  Hope is hard work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With all of the upheaval we are going through now, Allen recognizes that Hammock&rsquo;s transcendent music can be a balm for our souls.</p>

			 <p>Terence Sweeney writes for Plough magazine about how the saints have lost relevance in our lives as he remembers the book of saints he had as a child.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is, alas, where we put saints’ lives when we become adults. The saints are irrelevant, eccentric, and imprudent. They are seemingly impossible guides for living in what W. H. Auden calls “the moderate Aristotelian city.” Francis of Assisi stripping bare in the streets, Augustine rejecting Roman wealth and power, Rose of Lima living a life of penance, Damien of Molokai living among the lepers, and Dorothy Day residing with Bowery bums and advocating for a society that won’t need soup kitchens. As the not-yet-canonized Dorothy Day put it, “Don’t call me a saint, I don’t want to be dismissed that easily.” What Day put her finger on is a deep scandal in the life of the church. To be declared a saint is to be relegated to children’s books, to be petrified on a pedestal, to be treated as irrelevant to our actual lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sweeney advocates for us becoming more like the saints, radical in leaving our footprint and that of the Spirit in the world. “Preach the gospel, and if necessary, use words,” is attributed to St. Francis of Assisi.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> What does that look like, though, for each one of us?</p>

			 <p><strong>How do you signal appreciation?</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There has been a fair amount of debate recently about the utility of being able to “like” posts on social sites. Specifically, this has come up in the form of discussion around the photo sharing site, Glass, and their decision to eschew ways to “like” a post. Although likes are standard throughout social media sites, the idea to exclude them is not new. As I mentioned in <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2021/08/19/a-picture-is.html">this post</a>, it’s one of the design principles that Glass follows that already existed on Micro.blog.</p>
<h2 id="low-cost-approval">Low-cost approval</h2>
<p>Some folks want an easy way of indicating enjoyment of a particular post.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have had the same thought as Becker. For example, if I post <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CBwYUD_jcq3">a collage on Instagram</a>, and it gets 14 likes (some from friends and family and some from total strangers that dig collages), it feels more rewarding than when I post it on my blog and I get no responses.</p>
<p>However, are the likes from friends and family just obligatory and reflexive? It’s hard to be sure. The feedback isn’t three dimensional, it doesn’t have much weight and it’s low quality. There’s no indication of <em>what</em> the person likes. It takes approximately one second to hit that heart button, so if people can do it while flying through a timeline, it can be difficult to know if they really spent any time looking at the post.</p>
<h2 id="the-shame-of-no-responses">The shame of no responses</h2>
<p>There are negative sides to even positive reinforcement mechanisms. What if no one responds to the post? It has been widely reported that teenage girls will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/04/instagram-young-women-self-esteem-essena-oneill">delete Instagram posts</a> when they don’t get enough likes within a certain time period. The absence of feedback can become a void. A self-critical voice then fills the void.</p>
<p>Despite much being made of Instagram&rsquo;s negative effect on the mental health, we have to remember that much of the material from the studies that show this are based on <a href="https://unherd.com/2021/09/facebooks-bad-science/">subjective self-reporting</a>. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Even subjective feelings of well-being represent valuable data, though. After all, we can’t usually objectively know how someone is feeling unless they tell us.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> We now have subjective pain ratings to render feelings as objectively as we can.</p>
<h2 id="when-even-positive-feedback-is-unwanted">When even positive feedback is unwanted</h2>
<p>In 2018, David Heinemeier Hanson, from Basecamp, wrote about how even <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/your-likes-hearts-and-flattering-comments-are-bad-for-my-brain-649e9010">good feedback can be problematic</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s the long-term exposure that does the harm. It’s the building of a tolerance. The cultivation of vanity. It’s not the first hit, but the forty-fifth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a week’s worth of abstinence from Twitter and Instagram that brought about this reflection. It felt liberating. Liberating not to play to a crowd with the power to instantly judge the performance. Liberating to be free from the likes, the hearts, and those flattering comments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He discusses the cycle of getting habituated to likes and then craving them and constantly checking for signs of approval. Eventually, the impetus to write is to get positive reinforcement. It doesn’t have to be the case that authentic writing suffers for this, but most of the time, that would be the end result of reorienting your goals purely to satisfy your audience.</p>
<p>One idea that buttresses David’s post is that Basecamp’s blogging solution, <em>Hey World</em>, doesn’t have these problems.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> The only way to comment on a post is to email the author. Nothing is public, so the performative aspect of commenting is absent.</p>
<p>I will note that not all of us have the problem David has where we get <em>too much</em> good feedback and have to run and take shelter, lest it swell out heads. While his choice to forego praise seems sensible enough for him, and perhaps helps him stay focused, I’m not sure it’s right for the rest of us. Occasionally, it&rsquo;s nice to know that someone is reading what we write.</p>

			 <p>Jonas Ellison on how we act more Christian on Halloween than on Christmas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During Christmas, we invite our personal favorite people into the confines of our home. But on Halloween, we’re out on front porches, stoops, and yards. Property lines are dissolved and everyone is welcome everywhere (well, there are always those few who turn their lights off on Halloween, but they have their own stuff going on).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definitely sparked some thinking. Jesus talks a lot about who is invited to the banquet and Ellison’s short analysis seems to work along those lines.</p>

			 <p>Charlotte Bismuth on taking a sabbatical from social media.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My eyes are no longer accustomed to the stillness of life. Sitting at my desk, in my NYC bedroom, I’m looking out at the building next door. Its rectangular windows are shaped like my cell phone screen, and during the first few days of my social media break, I almost expected them to scroll or fill with images. But they are fixed in brick. It’s an adjunct building for a hospital — I think it contains some labs and offices — so there’s barely ever any movement or change. Seeking movement and distraction, my eyes flit around my desk and room, resisting focus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve had that feeling, like my eyes are scrolling in some sort of mild nystagmus. It always reminds me that it’s time to get off Twitter.</p>

<p><strong>The radio started</strong> when I turned on the ignition. NPR was playing from when my wife drove the car before me. A guy was shrilly complaining about filling out paperwork for getting a vasectomy and being told that his wife also had to sign. He was livid and kept yelling, “this is my fertility!” The interviewer was gamely playing along, perhaps even as convinced as vasectomy man that his autonomy had indeed been violated. The man being interviewed went on to state that he had an epiphany come from this experience. “This is what women have to go through every day!” he forcefully exclaimed to the interviewer, as if a bolt of lightning had struck him from out of the blue.</p>
<p>The man on NPR was seemingly oblivious to the nature of marriage as a social contract between two individuals. It’s not a stretch to say that choices of reproduction are some of the most central decisions within this contract. To enter into a covenant relationship, in which two people very often decide to have children, and to exclude your spouse from that decision without their knowledge is a breach of that covenant. The man was perfectly comfortable being dishonest with his spouse (and seemingly, the interviewer was sympathetic to this stance), as long as everything was within his control. He didn’t understand that the partnership of marriage means ceding some control to the relationship, through communication and mutual agreement.</p>
<p>In Alan Noble&rsquo;s new book, <em>You Are Not Your Own</em>, he takes on the problems caused by worshipping autonomy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From this inauspicious start until today, “humanity’s fundamental rebellion against God has been a rebellion of autonomy,” writes Alan Noble in his latest book, You Are Not Your Own: Belonging to God in an Inhuman World. As the subtitle suggests, Noble’s premise is that modern society is fundamentally inhuman and that this inhumanity stems from the lie that we belong to ourselves. Like Adam and Eve, we believe that accepting our creaturely limits will likewise limit our happiness, so we reject God’s authority and end up experiencing what they did: distance from God, each other, and even ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>→ <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2021/november/alan-noble-not-your-own-belonging-god-inhuman-world.html">The Inhuman Consequences of Satan’s Oldest Lie</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m eager to dive into Noble&rsquo;s book, as I firmly believe the desire for autonomy that conquers natural law and community is a destructive force in contemporary society. When we speculate about the reasons for worsening divisions between people and mental health problems reaching a new high, we have cause to look at trying to decouple ourselves from anything that might anchor us. <em>We can&rsquo;t pull up our own roots because we feel like they are tethering us to the ground and expect to thrive.</em></p>

			 <p>From the review of Jonathan Franzen&rsquo;s new book, <em>Crossroads</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Franzen knows better than anyone that <strong>even a pinprick on the map can swell into a spiritual universe</strong>—yet he has always had trouble resisting the allure of the sweeping systems novel, set everywhere and, therefore, nowhere.</p>

			 <p>As so much on the internet now is locked behind paywalls, there is a new opportunity for curators. Many subscription-based publications now allow their subscribers to share links that give full access to a particular piece. The subscriber can then post a link on social media, giving their followers access to the article and, at the same time, the publication gets to advertise to a new potential subscriber.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This gives another tool to the curator, who can not only recommend writing, but can also give the reader access they might not have had without following the curator.</p>
<p>This new system feels almost necessary when so many publications are putting their work behind paywalls. It&rsquo;s a different landscape for those following the news on the internet than it was just a few years ago. The curator&rsquo;s primary advantage is taking a large chunk of the information that&rsquo;s out there and distilling it down to the best content. This was disrupted by the fact that paywalls that were put up by some of the top publications prevented the curator&rsquo;s followers from accessing it. Now that many of those publications allow access through sharing, the value that the curator provides increasingly important.</p>
<p>For someone who uses this new power to the reader&rsquo;s advantage, checkout [Dave Pell&rsquo;s NextDraft][2]. Pell bills himself as the &ldquo;editor of the internet&rdquo; and does an excellent job summarizing the day&rsquo;s interesting news.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Rick Astley and the Blossoms have been on a nostalgia trip lately. They&rsquo;re not reminiscing about old Astley tunes, though. They&rsquo;ve dug into the Smiths catalog for what amounts to the creation of a tribute band to the Morrissey/Marr collaboration. The Guardian has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/oct/10/rick-astley-blossoms-review-smiths-karaoke-albert-hall-manchester">details on the collaborative effort</a>, which is appropriately reverent.</p>
<p>I love this cover of &ldquo;Well I Wonder,&rdquo; a sort of deep cut from <em>Meat Is Murder</em> and what is one of my favorite songs by the Smiths. Astley and his band mates do a meticulous job staying faithful to the original, including even the rain samples at the end that enhance the somber mood of the song.</p>

<p>As regular readers will know, I’ve been trying to rely less on Amazon and branch out into other retail spaces. I have <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2021/08/10/conscientious-consumerism-and.html">written about the reasons</a> previously, so there is no sense in rehashing those. What I want to impart is how difficult it is to get out of the Amazon ecosystem. Simply put, Amazon is just better than other retailers. There are reasons they are as successful as they are, and other companies have trouble matching their level of service.</p>
<p>As an example, I have been looking for Borax recently, so I can whip up my own ant killer concoction.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I have searched the big box home improvement stores and none of the close locations have the product. So, I find myself back to Amazon. I had to order a track for the folding doors in my laundry closet. Again, none of the home improvement stores had the size I needed. Back to Amazon.</p>
<p>I thought the easiest way to break from Amazon would be through the ebook market. After all, ebooks are easy to deliver, and you don’t get any benefits from Amazon’s massive supply chain with those products. I found out that Rakuten Kobo has some benefits over the Kindle. It has built-in Overdrive and Pocket integration. The Kindle doesn’t have those kinds of features. For Amazon, the main objective of selling the Kindle, is to sell you ebooks. They’re not really as concerned about you getting other types of content that sit outside of their core business on the device. So, I ordered the new Kobo Libre 2, which ships 10/19.</p>
<p>After trying out Pocket for a while, I realized that it will very soon become inferior to the other read-it-later services in the pipeline. I already prefer Instapaper because it has much better options for exporting highlights. With Matter doing a soft launch and Readwise’s solution just around the corner, I’m not sure I want to get locked into Pocket. I realized that, for now, I can get by with my Kindle. So I initiated a cancellation of my order with Rakuten. I had to chat with a customer service representative to do it. He let me know that he would have to escalate to a different team to cancel the order. He couldn’t give me a time frame for the refund, but assured me he would email when it was done. After waiting out the day, I decided to call. I was given the same response by the customer service agent on the phone. I let him know that it was unusual to be charged on PayPal before an order was even fulfilled and that it’s also unusual to have to work with multiple teams to get a cancelation on an order. He was unmoved, but very enthusiastically let me know that they would get the refund done ASAP and email me.</p>
<p>The process of getting a refund from Rakuten reminded me of why Amazon dominates so many markets. Can you imagine having to work with multiple teams to cancel an Amazon order of something they didn’t have in stock yet? I’ve never had issues with Amazon refunds._ The process is simple._ Until other companies get that laser focus on customer experience and the technical and logistical infrastructure to back it up, it’s going to get harder and harder to compete with the internet giant.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

			 <p><strong>Jenn Champion</strong> first came to my attention when she covered Weezer’s blue album in full for the now seemingly abandoned Turntable Kitchen project Sounds Delicious. Turning the guitar-based record into a synthesizer journey, she remade the songs in her own image.</p>
<p>Champion comes back with the OYSTER KIDS and a lyric video for &ldquo;Love Nobody,&rdquo; one of her catchiest songs to date (and I’m including O.M.G, another really strong single). There is an incredible urgency to this song. It&rsquo;s as if Champion is ready to do whatever it takes to avoid the pain of potentially unrequited love. She&rsquo;s fighting with herself against her own instincts to give in.</p>

			 <p>Pitchfork <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/pitchfork-reviews-rescored/">recently revised ratings</a> on 20 albums from the past, mostly raising scores, but also lowering some, as well. It was a kind of a strange move, but to be fair, some albums are sleepers and you can’t always tell which ones will stick with you. I’ve long wanted to do a classics review blog post series where I only write about albums that have stood the test of time. There’s a different kind of love that you have for music with longevity that carries you through different seasons of your life.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2021/2e7e70a7ce.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>(Wilco’s <em>Sky Blue Sky</em> is one album that had its original rating revised upward).</p>
<p>It’s easy to be cynical about what Pitchfork is doing here, though. They’ve long held themselves as arbiters of taste, deriding work that falls outside the bounds of what they’ve identified as cool-in-the-moment. This sort of temporal attribution lends itself to revising history to fit whatever new parameters of cool have been introduced. Certainly, when the emperor has no clothes, which has been the case in many a Pitchfork fascination, he is easier to expose later on, once the mass hypnosis has worn off. When cooler heads prevail and senses lost in the rush of trendiness are back working, a more judicious appraisal of the work of art can be made. Maybe, though, just maybe, judgment is still clouded, but by whatever new trend has taken hold.</p>
<p>Freddie Deboer is <a href="https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-liz-phairs-self">having none of it</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which they are very close to explicitly admitting is the point: not that there was some deficiency in how the original scores were awarded, but rather that the scores look less like what a cool person thinks now. One little snippet helpfully points out that liking an artist was not cool when the review was written but is cool now; honest, but perhaps this should have been removed in the editing process!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deboer’s thoughts on the revisions are cutting, but insightful, as usual. He gets deep when he writes about Pitchfork’s performative aspect. In his mind, the writers at the publication would rather signal that they like cool music than listen to music they actually like. I guess you have to give something up in exchange for cultural capital (and ad dollars).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which, of course, is what Pitchfork has always been about, projecting a certain kind of image of yourself to your peers. Pitchfork is the apotheosis of music purely as signifier, signifier of being the right kind of person, the cool kind, the knowing kind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except for the occasional feature that gets linked to from somewhere else, I stopped reading Pitchfork years ago. I think it was when they were intellectualizing low-brow, mainstream hip-hop. Things like “When Chingy says, ‘I like the way you do that right thurr,’ he’s really launching a scathing critique of contemporary sexual mores.” They probably still do that kind of music criticism. I’m just not tuning in to find out.</p>

<p><strong>MUNYA</strong> is set to release her new LP, <em>Voyage to Mars</em>, in November. On tracks like, “Pour Toi” and “Cocoa Beach,” sounding much like fellow Quebecois, Men I Trust, she brings deep grooves and an impossibly smooth delivery. Sometimes, such as on &ldquo;Boca Chica,&rdquo; she throws in a little tropicalia-tinged bachelor pad ambience. Think a little bit less space age than Juan Garcia Esquivel but just as breezy as Astrud Gilberto.  </p>
<p>The first song I heard from the album was the cover of the Smashing Pumpkins &ldquo;Tonight, Tonight.&rdquo; My history with that song is complicated. I was a big Smashing Pumpkins fan after <em>Gish</em> came out and lost only a little of that enthusiasm when <em>Siamese Dream</em> made its debut. By the time <em>Mellon Collie</em> came out, though, and Corgan had insisted he wouldn’t play Lollapalooza if Pavement was on the bill, I started to realize the band wasn’t that cool. The bald dude stalking around the video for the rat in a cage song wasn’t even recognizable to me. The music didn’t feel that similar to the stuff the band I had loved in high school put out. I went and sold all of my Smashing Pumpkins CD’s at the local CD Alley, eager to put the band behind me.</p>
<p>Years and a brother obsessed with the band later, I started casually listening to SP again (I even kind of like some of their most recent work). I definitely have to admit that “Tonight, Tonight” is a beautiful song. MUNYA’s rework of it fits her style, but retains all of the beauty of the original. The song is less sweeping, and there are no grand orchestral elements, but it’s anchored in a pop style that brings freshness to the track.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://getmatter.app/">Matter</a> is a promising new read-it-later service that shies away from convention and introduces new ideas into a space already occupied by some heavyweight services. I can say, after only playing around with it for a short time, it handles highlighting the best of any service I&rsquo;ve used.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> However, like a lot of opinionated software, you have to buy into the premises on which its based. One of Matter&rsquo;s most prominent value propositions is that it is based around individuals, rather than publications. It&rsquo;s a direction that&rsquo;s not too far from the one <a href="https://link.medium.com/crRzVz0Nbkb">Medium is taking</a> (which looks pretty cool). This approach is front and center in the Matter introductory email.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matter is the only reading app that gives you one feed of all your favorite writers, from national columnists to indy bloggers to Substacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why are we designed around writers? Because we think the best indicator of an article&rsquo;s quality is who wrote it, not where it&rsquo;s published.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s another blow to traditional journalism and the gatekeepers thereof. The implementation in Matter is problematic, though. Despite the language used in the above statement, the assumption is that individuals use email newsletters. There is no way to subscribe to RSS feeds from within the app.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2021/8394c9351a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>To add an author, you get an indication that you are adding and RSS feed (even using the universally recognized RSS icon). However, this is what you get when you try to add a feed from a writer.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2021/4ccee2e5dd.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Reading between the lines, I can only come to the conclusion that they believe RSS is for publications and newsletters are for individuals. Certainly, the much written-about defection of major writers from traditional publications to their own Substack newsletters has to be informing this view. Individual writers have blogs, as well, though, and those blogs are still best followed through RSS.</p>
<p>You can easily add newsletters to Matter. The result is that you have direct access to writers through their newsletters, but Matter serves as a gatekeeper for other forms of distribution. I don&rsquo;t know what criteria gets you added to the Matter list of authors, but ultimately it seems like just another group of editors deciding whose work gets put out there. <em>So much for the democratization power of the internet.</em></p>

			 <p><em>Warning: This post contains spoilers for the second season of Ted Lasso, up through Episode 8. Originally written 9/12/2021 in my Day One journal (or as Matt Mullenweg would say, my private blog).</em></p>
<hr>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made it through Ted Lasso, S2 Ep. 8 now, and I have to say, I don&rsquo;t find myself enjoying it. The writers have decided to deconstruct Ted&rsquo;s character and drag all of us viewers along for the ride. What used to be charming colloquialisms and clever pop culture references, in the first season, now are portrayed as nervous tics. Ted&rsquo;s ability to read people and bring out the best in them now seems diminished in significant ways. He can&rsquo;t even give a pep talk without messing up most of it. In the first season, Ted was almost impenetrably cheery. He took criticism, and anger and let them bounce right off. This season, his uncertainty and self-doubt are nearly constant.</p>
<p>When I saw the intro for episode 8, I was surprised that there was a warning for violence as well as language. The language warning was familiar (and well needed) but the violence warning seemed new. When Jamie attacked his father, it was like the writers just hit a dead end at how to portray their relationship. At some point, the stories of acrimony from Jamie&rsquo;s perspective weren&rsquo;t enough. They felt they had to show us just how bad it was. Gone are the guilty pleasures of Rebecca&rsquo;s ways of undermining Ted as the primary source of conflict, replaced by raw physical assault.</p>
<p>The losses, even with high stakes like being relegated, didn&rsquo;t seem to really affect anyone in the first season, so sure was Ted&rsquo;s enthusiasm for making the players better people. In the second season, even the failure to achieve unlikely wins are a cause for existential dread. Nate, the unlikely success story of last year&rsquo;s shows, now seems like a villain, lashing out at others as he tries to hold his spot on the ladder of success.</p>
<p>In 2020, the show gave us the feel good television we needed so desperately, as most of us hunkered down indoors trying to insulate ourselves from a global pandemic. For a year that in many ways is shaping up to be just as bad, turning the tables on us and giving us this season of Ted Lasso feels a bit like the punch in the face that Jamie gave his dad.</p>

<p><strong>Revenge bedtime procrastination</strong> came up as a topic of discussion on Micro.blog a little while ago (I believe it was brought up by <a href="https://micro.blog/Omrrc">@omrrc</a> and <a href="https://micro.blog/jean">@jean</a>). It’s easy to fall into this practice, which is one in which you stay up late doing all manner of meaningless things just because the time before you go to bed is the only time that feels like your own. You mindlessly scroll through Twitter or vapid news headlines. You play a dumb game on your phone. Many times, this procrastination is done to counteract a day full of meeting demands and the expectations of others. For me, the late evening is sometimes the only part of the day when I don’t feel bad. So, even as my health improves, I’ve still found myself in a pattern of looking at that time as window of opportunity.</p>
<p>Anne Helen Peterson recently <a href="https://annehelen.substack.com/p/revenge-bedtime-procrastination">took on the subject </a>in her newsletter. She dives into the ways this behavior is a self-sabotaging, because of course losing sleep doesn&rsquo;t help us in the short or long run.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s illogical and annoying and only makes things worse. But it’s also what our souls do when we refuse to nourish them. They sabotage our most perfect intentions for sleep, because sleep is not the same as leisure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A commenter, <a href="https://substack.com/profile/13560677-leah-libresco-sargeant">Leah Libresco Sargeant</a>, noticed the parallel between this behavior and this particular passage in <em>The Screwtape Letters</em> by C.S. Lewis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the uneasiness and reluctance to face it cut him off more and more from all real happiness, and as habit renders the pleasures the vanity and excitement and flippancy at once less pleasant and harder to forgo&hellip;you will find that anything or nothing is sufficient to attract his wandering attention. You no longer need a good book, which he really likes, to keep him from his prayers or his work or his sleep; a column of advertisements in yesterday&rsquo;s paper will do. You can make him waste his time not only in conversation he enjoys with people whom he likes, but also in conversations with those he cares nothing about, on subjects that bore him. You can make him do nothing at all for long periods. You can keep him up late at night, not roistering, but staring at a dead fire in a cold room. All the healthy and outgoing activities which we want him to avoid can be inhibited and nothing given in return, so that at last he may say&hellip;”I now see that I spent most my life doing in doing neither what I ought nor what I liked.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage, of course, is the voice of the reliably bad Uncle Screwtape, teaching his dear demonic nephew Wormwood how to ruin a person’s life. Given the strength of Lewis’ apologetics in the book, and the arguments for resisting temptations, I truly now have a different perspective on putting off bedtime.</p>

Most of the people who played Dungeons and Dragons or read Harry Potter aren’t leading covens right now. Past decades’ political tumults are now far distant, have been replaced by others, and didn’t turn out to be the Armageddons people told us they would be at the time.

This story of a square (by retro standards) boy who goes to a girl&rsquo;s house for a date and gets treated to a dance routine is well choreographed. The dance itself involves a little <em>Flashdance</em>, a little Steve Martin King Tut and just a splash of Chris Farley as a Chipendale&rsquo;s dancer. When the dance evolves to synchronized swimming, it&rsquo;s on. I kept waiting for the couple to kiss at the end&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Chris Hayes <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/essay/on-the-internet-were-always-famous">writes for the New Yorker</a> on how the internet has brought about a kind of pseudo-fame that’s accessible to just about everyone. His view of fame is that it is a disruptive force, rather than something that you should strive to attain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This, perhaps, is the most obviously pernicious part of the expansion of celebrity: ever since there have been famous people, there have been people driven mad by fame. In the modern era, it’s a cliché: the rock star, comedian, or starlet who succumbs to addiction, alienation, depression, and self-destruction under the glare of the spotlight. Being known by strangers, and, even more dangerously, seeking their approval, is an existential trap. And right now, the condition of contemporary life is to shepherd entire generations into this spiritual quicksand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the state of our collective mental health, it&rsquo;s hard to argue against the dangers Hayes brings up. Are reports of mental health problems simply more widely reported because the stigma on discussing those issues has become softer? Or are the issues more prevalent, and if so, why? Hayes and others postulations of the dangers of social media and chasing ephemeral internet fame certainly <em>feel</em> like they could be pinpointing at least part of the problem.</p>
<p>As we learn more about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/14/facebook-aware-instagram-harmful-effect-teenage-girls-leak-reveals">Instagram’s effects on the emotional health of young women</a> in particular, it’s time to reflect on the aspect of trying to seek the approval of strangers in a simulacrum of fame. Seeking this approval leads to examination of what brings attention and an attempt to model those looks and behaviors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a “mental health deep dive”, marketing and product design executives and data scientists at Facebook concluded that some of the problems, such as “social comparison”, were specific to Instagram and not replicated by other platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neil Postman is referenced in the Hayes piece, as TV was the prophesied bridge to our modern state of pursuing amusement over meaningful discourse. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Even though he was still alive for the rise of the internet, I’m pretty convinced Postman would be absolutely apoplectic at what has become of culture in the wake of social media. If TV reduced our attention span to consume edifying work, social media has drained it even further. TLDR is a much used acronym for a reason. The barrage of information coming at us makes us victims more than conscious participants in this degradation. <em>But who is going to help us if we are unable to help ourselves?</em></p>

<p>It may be just a bit too early for posts about Christmas. Frankly, it seems like it’s too early for Halloween decorations, but some of my neighbors started working on their haunting displays back in September.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Despite our distance from the “happiest time of the year,” though, I had to post this because I’ve been enjoying this cover song.</p>
<p>For its tenth anniversary, She &amp; Him are releasing <a href="https://www.mergerecords.com/product/a_very_she_him_christmas">a deluxe version of their Christmas album</a>. They got clever in adding bonus tracks and bent the rules a bit by putting in a cover of Madonna&rsquo;s &ldquo;Holiday,&rdquo; instead of a proper Christmas song.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> I’m okay with the band coloring outside of the lines when the final drawing looks this good. Somehow, the duo figure out how to add a smidge of honky tonk, guitar noise (thanks to Matt Ward’s tasteful use of distortion) and also a bit of funk. The last addition surprised me most, considering the original song was written by Pure Energy, a disco/post-disco group, whereas Zooey and Matt aren’t known for bringing the funk. Zooey sounds as delightfully distinctive as ever, and I love the fact that you can recognize her vocals instantly.</p>
<p>It’s hard to beat early Madonna. The songs and their production have aged well. She &amp; Him definitely make a solid attempt and give us a track that we can listen to not just at Christmas, but all year round.</p>

			 <p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2021/1c56ad9afc.jpg" alt="Brothertiger - Arizona"></p>
<p>Brothertiger comes the closest of any band I can think of in blending a 2010 chillwave aesthetic with 80&rsquo;s sophistipop sensibilities. It&rsquo;s the most obvious on the new <em>Heaven</em> EP, which compiles 4 singles that sound like they were recorded together. However, while it doesn&rsquo;t stray too far from the formula of the other songs, Brothertiger&rsquo;s John Jagos describes &ldquo;Arizona&rdquo; as being influenced by the early nineties and touring. The video and song paint a picture of the vast desert landscape being punctured at times by the intertwining highways of the city. The freedom of driving in that landscape dominates the lyrics.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but be reminded of the few months I lived in Albuquerque in the 11th grade. We would drive off-road in the desert sand to get to school in my friend&rsquo;s gas-guzzling Jimmy. Not having to adhere to the designated routes and the city streets was something of an intoxicant that early in the morning.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/09/28/epic-fortnite-metaverse-facebook/">The Washington Post</a>: “The metaverse, to Sweeney, would be an expansive, digitized communal space where users can mingle freely with brands and one another in ways that permit self-expression and spark joy.” Users mingling freely with brands — if that’s not Paradise Regained I don’t know what is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jacobs cynical take on these futurists’ visions of what life beyond our physical limitations resonates strongly with me. That is, what Epic games is proposing doesn’t exactly sound like Paradise Regained. It sounds like, well, a phrase Jacobs himself coined: “metaphysical capitalism.”</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2021/0fc53d48ae.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>However, every once in a while, I find myself wanting to mingle with brands. When those brands come up with clever tie-ins, it could soon part a fool like me and his money. This <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/nerds">D&amp;D and Nerds campaign</a> is one such partnership. Buy a box of candy and get a dungeon crawler to go with it. Not a shabby deal.

			 <p>As a student of psychology, I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated and disturbed by the concept of failure to thrive. It is distressing to learn all the ways our most closely related animal cousins have been treated in order to test out theories about this phenomenon. However, I never would have thought to link failure to thrive to remote learning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We labor under the myth of being an “information-based” society. We imagine that we are deeply informed, have ready access to massive amounts of information on the basis of which we are able to make free and well-considered decisions. This over-simplification of our human experience is deeply flawed. Among the things we’ve learned in the past year-and-a-half is that “distance education” doesn’t work very well. There’s a good reason for that: education is not merely about the acquisition of information. Interaction with a computer screen in insufficient. We are social beings and require the presence and direct interaction with others in order to learn well and fully. Our mistake about all of this could be compared to imagining that infants merely need milk and not touch, cuddling, cooing, and the human face. We know the result of such mistaken notions: babies die, suffering from “failure to thrive.”</p>

There&rsquo;s a charm to this song and just the right amount of noise amidst pop hooks.

			 <p>Last year, as music venues shut their doors, the hype began to quickly build around streaming concerts online. Several players entered the field, including Bandcamp. Twitch rapidly expanded their music team.  However, live streaming events didn&rsquo;t take off as expected. Even as so many artists are still cancelling tours, the industry doesn&rsquo;t seem to be picking up and filling the void.</p>

			 <p>I read the different reactions to Season 2 of Ted Lasso and realize that your experience of it may be dependent on the type of escapism you need in your life right at the moment. I came across <a href="https://twitter.com/mikecosper/status/1439572019260055552?s=12">a tweet thread</a> from Mike Cosper where he reflected on his level of enjoyment of the various episodes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Season 2 <em>almost</em> lost me in the first few episodes. It was too cheery, and I just kept holding on hoping it would turn around. But nothing was at stake. It was just 30 mins of everybody liking each other.</p>

Rodgers and other Republicans followed up with Facebook and asked about the company’s internal research on the effects of its products on mental health, the company did not share the Instagram research results, according to Bloomberg, nor did it share them with Sen.

			 <p>In a recent post, Chad Ragsdale regrets the decline of morality in western civilization. He argues against the laying down of arms in the culture war, and starts his argument with a trip to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame (which he says is all-but-required when you visit Cleveland).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you walk into one of the exhibits, you are greeted by a bank of televisions broadcasting in mostly black and white. Each television is playing looping videos of angry preachers with bad haircuts and cheap suits decrying the great moral evils of rock and roll music. It is a not-so-subtle lampoon. The silly, morally panicked preachers are displayed as trophies, heads mounted on the walls of this temple to rock music. The theologian/preacher in me stood for a moment and payed homage to these preachers, listening to their messages. Despite being a bit over-the-top, I had to admit that they weren’t completely wrong. Listening to the filth that has become commonplace in the music landscape, it’s hard to make the case that music hasn’t encouraged moral degradation in our culture and especially in our youth. If you think I sound old fashioned or alarmist just remember that a song about female genitalia spent four weeks at the top of the charts in 2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of think pieces with the intent to persuade us of the futility in engaging with cultural protest. Ragsdale takes the opposite side, draws his sword, and wades into the thick of the fight. He does, however, think we need to pick our battles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some battles are mere distractions. Some battles are futile. Some battles are just foolish. For instance, in 1997 did we really need to lose our minds over the Harry Potter series? Was this a battle worth fighting? In my opinion, no, it was foolishness born out of paranoia and ignorance. We expended resources and energy on a futile and foolish battle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He uses an interesting example, because someone recently <a href="https://micro.blog/simonwoods/11900352">mentioned to me</a> that the priest in the church he grew up going to frequently railed against Harry Potter. What are the hills on which we are prepared to die?</p>

			 <p>**Some Christians are looking for religious liberty exemptions from employer-based vaccine mandates. **</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2021/1ce0d57b47.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of the CDC." title="Vaccine"></p>
<p>David French <a href="#">writes about the surge in Christians</a> (mostly those who consider themselves Evangelical Christians) who are seeking religious exemptions from having to get COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, there is a scramble by Christian Americans to seek “religious exemptions” from employer vaccine mandates. I’ve received correspondence from Christian religious liberty ministries who report a sharp rise in requests for legal assistance to secure religious exemptions. One ministry indicated in an email to affiliated attorneys that it had been “inundated by requests” for help. A pastor in a large church in California has promised to hand out “religious exemption forms” to anyone who attends the church and asks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth is that there are very few exemptions on religious grounds, unless there is a long-standing mandate in that denomination to oppose medical science or vaccines.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Russell Moore, who has been working on religious liberty cases for 8 years, <a href="#">covers this topic</a> in his newsletter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In certain, very limited cases they could be. Someone who is part of, for instance, a religious tradition that eschews all medical treatment, along with any other shots or inoculations, could make a credible claim to religious liberty. There are very few such groups—and no group that I’m aware of with a creedal prohibition on masks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond that, the principle is well established in American law and culture that public health measures are a legitimate state interest. Almost all public schools have required, for years, proof of vaccination for polio and smallpox, etc. The United States military certainly has the mandate to keep troops from dying off from a potentially deadly disease. Certainly, private businesses have the right to ask potential customers to abide by their safety protocols.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that the most vocal Christians, and those that are covered the most by media, are some of the people most vehemently opposed to public safety standards is yet another reason to lament the state of American Christianity.</p>

			 <p><strong>Mars Hill Church reveled in being Christian the manly way.</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I recently started listening to the much-acclaimed podcast on the Rise and Fall of Mars Hill, produced by Mike Cosper. Mars Hill is the Seattle-based church that was founded by hyper-masculine pastor Mark Driscoll. I always found Mark Driscoll to be deeply suspect and wondered where he fit into Christian theology. In many clips I see or hear of him, he&rsquo;s yelling &ldquo;who do you think you are???!!!&rdquo; or &ldquo;how dare you!!!&quot;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> He sounds like me when I think my wife has eaten the dark chocolate marshmallows from Trader Joe&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>In audio clips from the podcast, Driscoll goes on about running people at his church over with a bus and there being a pile of dead bodies behind the bus. I could see Driscoll being a drill sergeant or the coach of a sports team, but repping for the Prince of Peace?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> It always puzzled me that someone would actually buy into that.</p>
<p>There are indisputably those who benefit from Driscoll’s message of personal responsibility. It resonates strongly with young men. It can be helpful, but like the teachings of Jordan Peterson, it’s not uniquely Christian in its nature. It could come from any self-help guru. It could come from Matt Foley.</p>
<p>I love Mike Cosper and he does a fantastic job with the production values of his podcasts, but I pretty quickly realized I had no interest hearing about this particular figure and his church. The whole situation is alien to my experience, since the denomination that I am part of, PC(USA), doesn&rsquo;t have celebrity pastors. You won&rsquo;t find dudes in thousand dollar sneakers trotting around a stage. Instead, you will find teaching elders (women included) typically preaching in traditional vestments from behind an old fashioned pulpit.</p>

			 <p>My 9-yr.-old loves video games. It seems sometimes like his love for video games surpasses his love for everything else. When he&rsquo;s not playing video games, or negotiating with me about his game time limits, he&rsquo;s watching others play video games on YouTube. The pandemic hasn&rsquo;t really bothered him, because it did nothing to interfere with his favorite activities.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2021/ac057bed9d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Since I set game time limitations, the main concern I have had about these patterns is the exclusivity of his entertainment choices. Unlike when I was a child, or even when his brother was growing up, he doesn&rsquo;t watch shows with narrative or characters.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It&rsquo;s nearly always some guy playing a video game and yelling at the screen. That doesn&rsquo;t seem to be teaching him much.</p>
<p>The only thing I&rsquo;ve noticed that these videos may have improved is his vocabulary, as most of the YouTubers are older and have more sophisticated ways of communicating than younger kids. However, his language has also commensurately, at times, become <em>more colorful</em>. Just like his heroes, he talks a lot when he plays games. Most of the time, he just seems frustrated, always accusing some online unknown person of &ldquo;hacking.&rdquo; Today, he was talking about someone making mistakes, &ldquo;as a newb&rdquo; but then said, &ldquo;what the eff do you think you are doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that point, I heard a record scratch. I admonished him, of course, but more than that, I started thinking that perhaps open access to YouTube is not beneficial for this child. I&rsquo;m going to look at getting the Disney Circle back up and running, so I can limit time on YouTube and on which devices he will have access to it.</p>
<p>It was scary enough when my progeny said he didn&rsquo;t need to go to college because he was going to be a YouTuber, and they don&rsquo;t need college degrees. Now that he&rsquo;s taking foul mouthed language queues from these guys (and all the ones he watches are guys), I&rsquo;m at the breaking point.</p>

			 <h3 id="back-to-the-future-et-and-the-wonder-of-a-non-violent-blockbusterhttpsconsequenceofsoundnet202007non-violent-blockbusters"><a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/07/non-violent-blockbusters/">Back to the Future, E.T., and the Wonder of a Non-Violent Blockbuster</a></h3>
<p>In this piece for Consequence of Sound, Andrew Bloom looks at three films that brought us wonder and suspense, plus made gobs of money, and didn&rsquo;t rely on violence as a crutch. His point is that these films are a dying breed, but they don&rsquo;t have to be. We could take their DNA and bring them back from extinction, if you will.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But there’s a model, in movies like <em>Back to the Future, Mary Poppins, and E.T.,</em> for exciting, special effects-heavy films that don’t rely on high-powered scuffles to create their spectacle and awe. Big problems that must be solved, eye-catching showcases, and great escapes can all provide a means for cinema’s auteurs to wow audiences along a different dimension. In the process, these types of movies provide an alternative to the monotony of the standard third-act action sequence and call for more imagination than the usual collision of fists and firepower.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2021/08/07/is-the-suicide.html">briefly about this recently</a>, as part of a discussion of a piece in the Guardian about how <em>The Suicide Squad</em> signals the beginning of the end for superhero movies. The piece argued that the over-the-top violence was one of the signs that the genre was starting its death throes. One would like to hope that the violence has reached a saturation point and movie makers will have to turn to other means with which to elicit excitement from the audience.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, my sister was asking about WandaVision. She was thinking about checking it out, but more drawn in by the style of the decades of sitcoms than the prospect of fight sequences. She&rsquo;s not a big Marvel or super hero movie fan. When my brother and I told her about the third-act action sequence, she seemed to lose interest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But there should also be room for alternatives. You don’t have to be a pearl-clutcher to worry about the consequences of our culture’s biggest films consistently culminating in violence, especially when that violence is often sugarcoated and bloodless. The answer isn’t to blame violent films for every societal malady, let alone ban them entirely. It is, nevertheless, worth considering the likely effects of so many tentpole films increasingly fitting the same, battle-heavy mold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bloom acknowledges that popcorn movies can be great, but they shouldn&rsquo;t monopolize the big screens. He relies on the old adage that &ldquo;variety is the spice of life.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blockbusters as a whole are a reminder that the bombastic and incredible can be made possible. That type of wonder is not limited to the realm of firefights and fisticuffs. It also runs through the breathless getaway, the brilliant solution, and the fanciful places where ink and paint meet flesh and bone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>​It would be great to have at least a few alternatives, <em>even if the big-budget action flick is not going to disappear entirely anytime soon.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2021/257c8c3624.jpg" alt="Work Drugs/Pictured Resort Split EP"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Last week, I chose a live recording of Pictured Resort covering Craft Spells &ldquo;After the Moment&rdquo; for the Friday Night Video. I had also searched last week for a Bandcamp link for Work Drugs &ldquo;Drive&rdquo; as my lady friend and I had picked that as a standout on my playlist of new songs. I couldn&rsquo;t find the track to share. However, when I went to Bandcamp to search for more tracks by Pictured Resort, I came across the split EP with Work Drugs and the lead track just happened to be &ldquo;Drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This song sounds like it would be perfect in a movie like Mannequin, as Andrew McCarthy and Kim Cattrall cruise around the city streets at night in a sports car (although I believe in the movie it was a motorcycle). &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t @ me,&rdquo; as the kids say. When a mannequin spends her existence locked in a store, and only becomes animated at night, there is a lot of life to be lived during the hours when the sun is down. The lyrics reflect wistfulness, but the song still promotes the power of relationships to break us out from the mundane.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m breaking my usual guideline of not engaging in hot takes on major issues to call attention to this important piece in the Atlantic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s plenty of blame to go around for the 20-year debacle in Afghanistan—enough to fill a library of books. Perhaps the effort to rebuild the country was doomed from the start. But our abandonment of the Afghans who helped us, counted on us, staked their lives on us, is a final, gratuitous shame that we could have avoided. The Biden administration failed to heed the warnings on Afghanistan, failed to act with urgency—and its failure has left tens of thousands of Afghans to a terrible fate. This betrayal will live in infamy. The burden of shame falls on President Joe Biden.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>George Packer has the authority to write on the subject of abandoning Afghan allies because he has been following these Afghans for some time. The news outlets have been reporting on the plight of these people intensely for the last few months and with some regularity now for years. This is the second major betrayal of a group of our allies in recent memory.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Why a group of people with anything to lose would ever again work with the United States is beyond my comprehension.</p>

<p>Paul Riismandel writes for Radio Survivor about the inaccuracies in all of those articles trumpeting the demise of the CD corresponding to the rise in vinyl purchases. He notes initially that the number of units moved  based on the total sales is deceiving, because CD&rsquo;s are much cheaper than vinyl.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> CD&rsquo;s, in fact, are holding their own as a physical medium on which to acquire music.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As vinyl sales dropped in the 90s in favor of digital discs, companies pressed fewer records, and pressing plants gradually shut down. While CD sales have slowed in the last decade, they haven’t yet experienced the kind of drop-off that vinyl did. Although the last ten years have seen a vinyl resurgence, aging plants struggled to keep up with demand, and new plants came on line, all increasing costs. CDs, on the other hand, became a mature technology, with production costs having pretty much bottomed out in the early 2000s, and not having increased much since then.</p>

			 <p>Tonight we have Japanese band Pictured Resort covering Craft Spells' &lsquo;After The Moment.&rsquo; The original is probably my favorite song in the Craft Spells catalog. Pictured Resort honor the song with this straightforward cover and look like they are having fun while doing it. It reminds me of a time when jangle pop was having a bit of a revival with the new bands on Captured Tracks and chillwave was also in its ascendancy. The overall sound of Pictured Resort covers territory in both of those genres. I just discovered this band because they did a split single with neo yacht-rockers Work Drugs and I&rsquo;m going to have to dive deeper into their catalog.</p>

<p>Cory Doctorow on the inevitable (at least in his view) implosion of Uber. He uses the phrase &ldquo;Uber is doomed,&rdquo; or something similar, probably a dozen times in this piece. That, my friends, is conviction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I live in Burbank, where Ubers were never more than 5 minutes away. Now, a 30 minute wait is common — and the fare is comparable to the licensed taxi company, which is literally one app away from achieving feature parity with Uber.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marvel’s crescendoing epic Avengers: Endgame, with its colossal box office showing two years ago, will undoubtedly represent the peak of the superhero movie’s popularity. The Suicide Squad meanwhile may prove to be to the superhero movie what The Wild Bunch was to the western: a bloody, game-changing end to one phase, and the beginning of another, even richer one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no interest in seeing the Suicide Squad and frankly, it saddens me to see yet a new low in profanity and gore in superhero movies. I wonder when we&rsquo;ll reach the bottom. The author of the piece, Brogan Morris, seems to believe the new self-aware and perhaps even self-effacing superhero movie may bring more complexity along with the grit. I don&rsquo;t welcome this new phase but if it does, as Morris seems to believe, represent the last phase of superhero movies before the genre fades away, I can accept it as such.</p>
<p>I have to question, though. <em>Is it even possible that we can get away from pure spectacle and back to more modest mid-budget movies again?</em></p>

			 <p>Apple feels a little bit lost with regards to its implementation of Safari 15. The new look of the native Apple web browser was announced to much fanfare but a less than exuberant reaction from users. I&rsquo;ve read a lot of opinions on the new layout and features and certainly more negative than positive.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I find it surprising that Apple seeks feedback on the new design. It’s a good thing but also surprising has they tend to do their thing alone. Now, they look a bit in distress while searching for a solution. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->numericcitizen.micro.blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Numeric Citizen <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/07/27/ive-been-invited.html">https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/07/27/ive-been-invited.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I can remember years ago when Apple put the browser tabs on the top in a beta release. The tabs looked like part of the toolbar chrome and they were evenly sized, differing in length by the number of them you had open. If you had 2 tabs open, they would each take 50% of the browser window. I thought it was genius but I was in the minority. Apple changed the implementation and put the tabs back below the address bar, where they had always been. Apple can be opinionated, but they also listen to their users.</p>
<p>Matt Birchtree <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/vivaldi-offers-a-usable-ui-when-matching-the-webs-colors/">compares the way Safari handles the color</a> of web pages being integrated into the browser chrome to the way Vivaldi handles it. He finds the UI on Vivaldi to be much more compelling and usable when adopting the same concept.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think Safari is in a better place today than it was a couple months ago, but it&rsquo;s still not living up to the usablity standards Apple holds its products to in my opinion. I do give Safari the edge in having larger tabs that show more of the website title in most cases, but this theming feature is not quite right yet. Hopefully Apple can make it great by when this ships in the fall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It sounds like like Apple still has some work to do in order to satisfy their user base. I hope they come up with something that retains the originality of the initial design vision but also makes gains in usability. Some people want browser chrome and some prefer it to be fade into the background, putting the website first and foremost. It may be hard to satisfy both camps.</p>

<p>I love that this Facebook ad spotlighting a retro skateboarding trick starts with footage of Ray Barbee from the Powell Peralta skate video <em>Ban This</em> (Bones Brigade 5). My mom and I used to love watching Barbee&rsquo;s part in that video because his style was so smooth. He went from trick to trick like he was connecting the dots.</p>
<p>The no comply lost its popularity shortly after I started skateboarding, so I could only do the standard 180 and not any of the cool variations that people have developed over the years. It wasn’t until years later that I realized older tricks, like no complies, and boneless tricks were actually really fun. In my earlier days, almost anything where you would step off of your board was pretty much verboten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have friends whose grandchildren keep them awake at night, friends who gave up religion long ago but who still believe in prayer because what else is there?

<p>Prayer is something to which even unbelievers can turn to in times of crisis. This is not a universal rule, but prayer seems to be something to which we are oriented, regardless of our religious formation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Demand forces a collector to think ahead—&ldquo;Will I ever want this in my collection?&quot;—and pull the trigger within minutes of a record going on sale, lest it sell out and you pay several times the retail price when you realize later that indeed, that record is something you had to have. You live in fear of reaching a point in the future where you wish you bought that thing that you could have. Hobbies are supposed to be about pleasure, but for me, what has taken over this hobby is another sensation all together: anxiety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This process is one of the reasons I mostly stopped buying vinyl records a while ago. It seemed I was never quick enough to get in on those limited edition colored vinyl editions of albums before they were snatched up by the heavily-online collectors. To be clear, I was never buying records for the sake of trying to make money off them going up in value. I wasn&rsquo;t a vinyl speculator. I just wanted to listen to my favorite bands in the best-sounding way possible and have something tangible to enjoy along with the experience. Growing up with musical artifacts, it has been hard to completely give them up. Vinyl gives you all the tactile experience you could want, with huge art and a spinning to disc to watch while you are absorbing the tunes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you have to make the calculation if the record is worth buying on preorder before the songs have been released or risk losing out on getting the best version of the vinyl. That matters, whether you are speculating or simply want to enjoy
the most aesthetically pleasing version of the album.</p>

			 <p>The first user of the beta Posts+ feature on Tumblr <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tumblr-community-lash-out-post-plus-subscription/">received death threats</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I felt like the sacrificial lamb, because they didn’t announce Post+ beforehand and only gave it to a few people, which landed me in the crosshairs of a very pissed-off user base when I’m just trying to pay off medical bills by giving people the option to pay for content,” Kaijuno told TechCrunch. “I knew there’d be some backlash because users hate any sort of change to Tumblr, but I thought that the brunt of the backlash would be at the staff, and that the beta testers would be spared from most of it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing beta software always comes with risks. This is often made clear in some form of beta testing agreement. To state the obvious, it isn&rsquo;t usually the case that the risk comes in the form of a rabid community of users threatening your life. Tumblr has a notoriously committed community that can be very critical of any change to their beloved platform. While users can be hostile towards those who make changes to their favorite software, I&rsquo;ve never seen this sort of vitriol directed at beta testers who are trying out the changes.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

One of the biggest faults of the prequels, the premise of which doomed them from the start, was how they were conceived to fill those mysterious holes that appeared in the original trilogy. Even the Disney sequel films suffered from this inclination to reveal all. As much as I wanted to see the enigmatic Knights of Ren that were hinted at in The Force Awakens, I couldn’t help but be disappointed when they actually appeared on screen. Those who have a hand in creating Star Wars properties need to know that the audience should be afforded some allowance to use their imaginations.</p>

There is no inner peace. There can be burning anger and a nattering inner voice of opposition that lingers for days. In terms of shame, it doesn’t matter if you are right. Shame loves the categories of right and wrong. It only matters that your opponent disagreed and that you shamed them. Shame is like the game of global thermonuclear war: the only option is not to play.&rdquo;</h3>

			 <p>I recently showed my wife my iPhone screen, which was dulled by complete grayscale. She responded by telling me that it didn&rsquo;t look as interesting without the colors. Which was just the point. The once vibrant phone, alluring to my eyes, was now rendered much more boring. The bloom had come off the rose, and my attention was my own again.</p>
<p>We spend so much time just dorking around on our phones. We intentionally pick it up to  perform a task, but how often does our phone overstay it&rsquo;s welcome as we just start clicking on one thing after another? There are times that I pick up the phone to check something, forget what I wanted to check and end up looking at something entirely different.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/internet-culture/deep-dives/how-to-enjoy-being-online-again/">a Moz://a post</a> about how to actually enjoy being online again, Rebecca Smith details how you can avoid distractions and only get online for the things you need or that bring you enjoyment. One of the ways she avoids distraction is by turning on grayscale in accessibility settings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How often do you find yourself mindlessly reaching for your phone and then scrolling through for no reason? You look down and it’s been an hour and you didn’t accomplish or learn anything, or even really find yourself entertained. Your time matters, and app logos and colors are designed and used to capture your attention for longer. The colors stimulate your brain, so by turning your phone to grayscale and stripping the colors, you may be less motivated to check your phone as often.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smith has other ideas, as well, some of which just promote Firefox and one of which is as simple as, &ldquo;just close your computer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Can I just keep buying records with 12 songs or so on them for around $20 and streaming every song in the world for $10 a month? That sounds better than owning a piece of a song for $50. Let’s not treat art like a corporate investment.</p>

Its earliest habitual use in American discourse goes back to the fifties and sixties, when American socialists would use it to disparage American communists—implying said communists were more committed to their ideological orthodoxies than to factual accuracy or moral clarity.”</h2>

In the early nineties, I remember my mom getting me a book called <em>Once Upon A More Enlightened Time</em> which simultaneously pointed out biases we might normally overlook in parts of fairy tales while also satirizing how the attempts to correct them could really miss the mark.</p>

<p>~ Rev. Dr. Serene Jones of Union Theological Seminary, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/02/25/religious-left-politics-liberal-471640">in a piece on the resurgence of the religious left</a>. When asked what issues are going to be important politically for the religious left, she mentioned Universal Basic Income and White Supremacy. I have seen the latter come up quite a bit, and our church has active programs around addressing the topic. I would also like to see the former come up more, given the experiments in this area have been successful and it fits in the mold of the Acts 2 church. Your church doesn’t have to be part of the Bruderhof community to recognize that the model of sharing that the earliest Christians presented can take a prominent place in how we view society.</p>

			 <p>I love <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2021/01/18/disgust-with-civilization/">this post</a>, about turning the tables on disgust, from Austin Kleon. In particular the quote below really speaks to me. I’m a  person who appreciates much of life but who also has a certain amount of frustration and sometimes revulsion with things that I see going on in the world. Even with these feelings, I want to present the positive more often than the negative. Kleon explains his formula to do just that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like  <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2018/06/18/a-warning-to-my-readers/">my readers</a>  see me as a fairly positive person, but I doubt they know how much I am driven by my disgust.</p>
<p>The trick is: I take the thing I’m disgusted with,  <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2019/07/17/negative-self-definition/">imagine the opposite</a> , and  <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2019/07/16/a-negative-approach/">push that out into the world</a> .</p>
<p>Identifying poison, privately, but  <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2020/05/20/finding-nourishment-vs-identifying-poison/">sharing nourishment</a> , publicly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same post, Kleon also mentions reading <a href="https://bear.app/faq/Advanced%20search%20options%20in%20Bear/#special-searches">Transforming Noncomformist</a>, a sermon from Martin Luther King Jr., that I will also plan to read in observance of the day.</p>

			 <p><strong>One of my favorite (former) music bloggers from back in the days of the old blogosphere, Frank Yang of Chromewaves.net, <a href="https://link.medium.com/ptMea42qTcb">just posted his 2020 music list</a>.</strong> Yang has been diving into a lot of post-punk lately, and reacquainting himself with some of the genre’s past luminaries (Echo &amp; The Bunnymen, The Psychedelic Furs, Siouxsie &amp; The Banshees, Bauhaus, The Sound, Sad Lovers &amp; Giants).</p>
<p>It’s interesting to see how his fascination with 80’s staples of alternative rock informs his choices of what was appealing in 2020. Although, a couple of the choices are new LP’s from some of those post-punk progenitors. As a bonus, you get a picture of Yang’s little guy in a cute Stone Roses onesie.</p>

			 <p><strong>An “Angry Staff Officer” writes for Wired magazine about how, as of <em>The Mandolorian</em> Episode 14, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mandalorian-stormtroopers-star-wars-tactics/">Imperial Stormtroopers are finally starting to understand battle tactics</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Previously, these characters couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn with their blasters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Charging forward and yelling &ldquo;Blast &lsquo;em&rdquo; seemed to be the limit of their ability to employ fire and maneuver against their enemies. It&rsquo;s as if their strategic development had begun with the assault wave tactics of 1914 or the Soviet human waves at Stalingrad and then just stayed there forever. If you don&rsquo;t have to worry about recruitment and retention, body counts aren&rsquo;t a metric that drive organizational change.</p>

While I have yet to see virtual reality implementations that really spark my interest, and my wife is a much bigger fan of ASMR than I am, I do like the idea of ASMR rooms. Newport tells of a reader who has a specific way of using the ASMR rooms to stimulate creativity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reader told me that she plays the video full screen on her computer while positioning a word processor document in front of it. She listens to the stereo sound in high quality noise cancelling headphones. Though she works out of a “small and noisy urban flat,” the video and sounds help her fall into a state of concentration when she needs to write.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could see that sort of practice being really helpful when writing. I may even try it out (except trade word processor for text editor).</p>

I agree with the assessment that this functionality just doesn&rsquo;t make sense on this platform the way it does on Instagram.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I could see a world in which Fleets work, but as a different version of the product which was launched. No one is asking for my product ideas, so I’m going to give them. I would keep Fleets — which is a great name — simple: they’re tweets that go away after a set period of time. They reside not in some unnatural carousel at the top of the feed but in the feed itself. They’re highlighted in some way to showcase their impermanence.</p>

			 <p>Matt Poppe has been reviewing each episode of the Mandalorian for Christ and Pop Culture and he picks up on something that intrigued me <a href="https://christandpopculture.com/the-mandalorian-recap-safety-not-guaranteed-season-2-episode-2/">in his piece about the second episode</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Mando tells the X-Wing pilots, “May the Force be with you,” one of them replies, “And also with you.” Is that officially a thing now? I knew we (Star Wars fans) often say, “And also with you,” because it feels right for those of us with a liturgical church background. But I don’t actually remember it being an official Star Wars-y thing. Someone tweet me what you think. A quick Google search makes me think this hasn’t actually been canon until now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the phrase “and also with you” was used to respond to “may the force be with you” it sounded to these liturgical ears like something so right and familiar. Yet, I too found myself wondering whether that had ever been used in Star Wars before. I’m pretty sure Poppe is right, this is something new to the Mandalorian.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In his piece for the Atlantic, <a href="https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-invasion-of-the-german-board-games?utm_source=pocket-newtab">The Invasion of the German Board Games</a>, Jonathan Kay brings up an interesting bit about how history informed the board game movement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In North America, the complex board games created during the latter half of the 20th century typically took the form of simulated warfare. In Risk, Axis &amp; Allies, Star Fleet Battles, and Victory in the Pacific, players take on the role of generals moving their units around tabletop maps. But for obvious reasons, this wasn’t a model that resonated positively with the generation of Germans who grew up in the shadow of the Third Reich. Which helps explain why all of the most popular Eurogames are based around building things—communities (Catan), civilizations (Terra Mystica), farms (Agricola)—rather than annihilating opponents. The result is a vastly more pacifist style of a game that can appeal to women as much as men, and to older adults as much as high-testosterone adolescents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had never thought about how Germans would have had an aversion to the American style of take-over-the-world conquest games. It makes sense, though, having lived through the terror or aftermath of the Nazi expansionist regime, that they would not want to emulate that as a form of play. I can also understand the extent to which the building style of games would appeal to a broader demographic.</p>

<p>I was literally just thinking about Mr. Todd yesterday. I can remember when we used to play Jeopardy on Fridays in his Economics class. One time, the answer, “The band that recorded ‘Proud Mary’” came up. I jokingly responded “What is Pearl Jam?” He got a big laugh out of that.</p>
<p>My wife and I were both in that class and have fond memories. I can’t believe how similar Mr. Todd looks in the pictures to when he was teaching us. The iconic mustache he wore was still there. My heart goes out to his family, friends and students.</p>

			 <p>🎵 The passing of Richard Swift was a tragedy and the musical legacy he left behind, not just through his own compositions, but through the production of the music of others, is an important one. I once wrote that Damian Jurado&rsquo;s bright and beautiful &ldquo;A.M. AM&rdquo; (you might recognize the song if you watched <em>Wild Wild Country</em> on Netflix) had more of Swift in it than it did Jurado.</p>
<p>One band that recorded with Swift was Pure Bathing Culture. As a remembrance of his work, they have just released a new EP, <em>Carrido</em>, that was created in Swift&rsquo;s studio, National Freedom. In addition to recording the EP there, they also covered my favorite Swift song, &ldquo;Would You?&rdquo; from his <em>Ground Trouble Jaw</em> EP. It&rsquo;s an exquisite version, with all of the shimmering softness we&rsquo;ve come to expect from Pure Bathing Culture. Take a listen below.</p>

			 <p>Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/07/01/facebook-boycott-facebook-stronger-347073">has a piece</a> on why the Facebook boycott by major companies likely neither cost the companies much nor impact Facebook very much. The timing is particularly important. The three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is during a historically slow sales month.</li>
<li>It is happening happening during a recession.</li>
<li>It coincides with the low-spending period of semi-quarantine.</li>
</ol>
<p>They make the point with an apt analogy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asking a corporation to boycott Facebook in July 2020 is a little like asking a casual drinker to observe Lent by giving up alcohol in a dry county.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I share the skepticism that this movement will gain much but another round of false contrition from Facebook, but I would love to be proven wrong.</p>

			 <p>🎵 <strong>Brothertiger - Fundamentals, Vol. 1</strong>: This EP is a departure from the normal sound of Brothertiger and not just because it eschews vocals in favor of completely instrumental tracks. The band is typically very good at crafting some of the catchier glo-fi songs you are likely to hear but <em>Fundamentals</em> takes the direction of organic sounding electronic soundscapes. The EP is described as &ldquo;a collection of instrumentals improvised through livestreaming.&rdquo; Think along the lines of Tycho. I&rsquo;ve had this as heavy rotation working music and will probably keep it there until it starts getting played incessantly between segments on NPR.</p>

			 <p>Michael Flarup believes the new UI in MacOS Big Sur is going to bring back a lot more creativity in visual design. In <a href="https://applypixels.com/blog/comeback">a post on the subject</a>, Flarup writes about the possibilities that are being opened up by the new interface and its guidelines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With this approach Apple is legalising a visual design expressiveness that we haven’t seen from them in almost a decade. It’s like a ban has been lifted on fun. This will severely loosen the grip of minimalistic visual design and raise the bar for pixel pushers everywhere. Your glyph on a colored background is about to get some serious visual competition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited to see MacOS get a fresh coat of paint, but it does feel a bit like everything old is new again.</p>

<p>This comes as no surprise. When I was a kid, I remember hearing this song in an anti-drug film we watched in health class. I was stunned by this guy who sounded like a demon screaming &ldquo;master&rdquo; over and over again. Drug addiction was presented as a devastating and uncompromising form of slavery. No track could have made the prospect of cocaine addiction sound more terrifying. &ldquo;Master of Puppets&rdquo; is a song that was much needed in the powder-powered 80&rsquo;s when it came out. From the jolting start, which could legitimately give you whiplash, to the darkly ponderous bridge, to the sounds of cruel laughter at the end, &ldquo;Master of Puppets&rdquo; packs a lot of impact in its 8+ minutes.</p>

			 <p>I was very close to leaving Instagram after I started seeing political ads a few weeks ago. I have never been on Facebook and deeply dislike some of the choices the company has made. However, I could always rationalize being on Instagram because politics has such a low profile on the service. Politics was rarely discussed (at least in my feed) and there were <strong>no</strong> political ads. I referenced this in a <a href="https://link.medium.com/xfUcDzgst7">post I wrote</a> about rejoining the service a few years ago. It’s really what kept me hanging on to Instagram after Facebook decided to allow dishonesty in political ads on their platform.</p>
<p>Once the ads started to appear, I stopped opening the Instagram app. I had not yet deleted my account, waiting and hoping that things would change. It appears that they will soon do just that, according to <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/06/voting-information-center/">this Facebook post</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Political ads play an important role in every election – and this year will be no exception. People have told us they want the option to see fewer political ads on Facebook and Instagram. After announcing this feature earlier this year we are now making it available as part of our preparations for the 2020 US elections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m happy to hear this because I enjoy Instagram. I’m just disappointed that the <a href="https://ownyourgram.com/">OwnYourGram</a> service that syndicates Instagram posts to your blog no longer seems to work.</p>

I’ve read a lot of pieces about the current president and his faith (or lack thereof). I don’t think two sentences better capture the dynamic than the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Trump, the Bible and the church are not symbols of faith; they are weapons of culture war. And to many of his Christian supporters watching at home, the pandering wasn’t an act of inauthenticity; it was a sign of allegiance—and shared dominance.</p>

<p>On a related note, I’ve read so many pieces from the Atlantic lately that I should probably start supporting them monetarily.</p>

<p>This year, around the holiday season, I’ve had a shift in my thinking about Christmas and the period of waiting that comes before. In the past, I’ve thought of the season of Advent as a joyous preparatory time for the a celebration that is Christmas. The onslaught of cheerful Christmas songs, that starts just as the tryptophan induced coma from Thanksgiving wears off, contributes to that way of framing things. Bing lets you know when it&rsquo;s beginning to look a lot like Christmas, and he doesn&rsquo;t seem at all concerned that the holiday is almost a month away.</p>
<p>Recently though, I’ve started to view Advent in a more Orthodox way, as more like Lent. As a time of fasting, rather than feasting. A time that starts in the darkness, as we make our way toward the light. It&rsquo;s a period of quiet contemplation, instead of the exuberant cacophony of bells from a sleigh, furiously driven to the big box stores in search of Black Friday door busters. Advent is to be waited out with patience and solemn hope.</p>
<p>Once the waiting is over, though, Christmastide begins. It&rsquo;s not a single day, but those mythical 12 days of Christmas of which another song informs us. The time of Christmastide extends from December 25th through January 5th, just before the Feast of Epiphany on January 6th. Each year, I make more of an effort to swim against the tides of culture that push Christmas as a single day. Of course, the day itself is kept well. Garrison Keillor writes in <a href="http://www.garrisonkeillor.com/suddenly-once-again-good-lord-its-christmas/">this post</a> about his Christmas ritual (which sounds remarkably like my own).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All I need for Christmas is Christmas Eve in church, holding a candle, singing “Silent Night” a cappella in the dark with the others, walking home through the city, and waking up in the morning with my wife and daughter. Three gifts apiece, one useful, one odd but interesting, one ridiculous. Dinner is nice. We can make it at home or if we go out for a McTurkey sandwich, that’s okay too. Then we get out the board games. A pot of Christmas tea. Nothing more is needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My family will no doubt spend the evening of Christmas trying to save the world from a pandemic and failing in disappointing fashion, if history is any indication. We’ll have collected various forms of tea from different sources around the world and will be imbibing heavily throughout the day. We will be glowing from singing “Silent Night,” while keeping candles from dripping wax onto our palms within the cozy confines of our church sanctuary the night before.</p>
<p>We’ll have a cornucopia of presents to open in the morning, despite having cut back with the introduction of Secret Santa a few years back. In doing so, we’ll dutifully engage in the American commercial Christmas tradition. David Warren <a href="https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/12/24/god-rest-you-merry/">writes about this</a> aspect of the holiday and ponders giving back the material in return for the mystical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though I love Charles Dickens, I like to dismiss him as “a commie,” for reasons that might not seem obvious at first. A Child’s History of England, I once threw against a wall. In his genius he pioneered the commercialization of Christmas, and every advertising agency should thank him. For consider, what this commercialization required. Scrooge is converted by sentimental ghosts, into a character of material generosity. The moral hints are materialist throughout. Joy, while it is still remembered, is subtly converted into happiness. Soon we have food stamps, and cash welfare, and shops full of Xmas presents, to buy lest Tiny Tim have a wrang.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gentle reader may not be surprised if I try to return this gift, and exchange it once again for the mystical. For while the story of the Nativity is easy enough to sentimentalize, and captures the imagination of small children (Jesus speaks to them, child to child), it is the document of an incredible event; without precedent, without compare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be hard to abandon our annual tradition of watching <em>A Muppet Christmas Carol</em>, but I understand what Warren means about redirecting the focus of the holiday. To snatch the lasting joy back from the impermanence of happiness. To hold on to something that carries over, year after year, despite external circumstances.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2019/08/07/republicans-now-are-more-open-to-the-idea-of-expanding-presidential-power/">new Pew Research poll</a>, the number of Republicans who say presidents could operate more effectively if they did not have to worry so much about Congress and the courts has increased 16 percentage points since last year, from 27% to 43%. Among only those classified as conservative Republicans, the number of those in favor of more presidential power has doubled in the past year. The fears that this president has promoted the idea of a totalitarian state to his followers seems to have been well founded. That should come as no surprise to those who noted the president’s open affection for dictators, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/05/donald-trump-praises-saddam-hussein-for-killing-terrorists-so-good/">including those as brutal as Sadam Hussein</a>.</p>
<p>It appears a certain segment of the population, particularly conservative Republicans, essentially want a king of the United States. This was the state of affairs in ancient Israel, in the time of the prophet Samuel. The prophet warned the people against putting themselves under the yoke of a king. However, the Israelites  had lost faith in God as deliverer and wanted a king to lead them to victory over the Philistines.</p>
<p>Samuel pleaded with his people to rethink looking for a king to rule them. They were persistent, though, and he brought their request to God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The LORD answered Samuel, “Comply with the people’s request—everything they ask of you—because they haven’t rejected you. No, they’ve rejected me as king over them.” “They are doing to you only what they’ve been doing to me from the day I brought them out of Egypt to this very minute, abandoning me and worshipping other gods.” “So comply with their request, but give them a clear warning, telling them how the king will rule over them.” <em>(1 Samuel 8:7-9, CEB)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m assuming that a fair amount of those who want to give unchecked power to the president are from a Judeo-Christian tradition. They, like the ancient Israelites, seemed to have lost their faith in God to protect them against their enemies, real and perceived. Many of the Christians who support the current president believe that a strongman with a desire to rule as a king is necessary to protect their religious traditions. On that subject, Alan Jacobs has <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/the-most-important-public-issue/">this to say</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For instance: Stretch your mind and imagine a POTUS who supports religious liberty but who also pursues reckless, thoughtless, and inconsistent policies both domestically and abroad. Imagine that he is cruel to the helpless, treacherous to longstanding allies, cozy with authoritarian regimes, incapable of sticking with a plan, prone to judge everyone he meets strictly by their willingness to praise and defer to him. Imagine that he is colossally ignorant of domestic and foreign realities alike and yet convinced of his matchless wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You might, first, ask whether such a President is a reliable ally of religious freedom. Would he work to guarantee liberty of conscience for those who on religious grounds criticized his own policies? Don’t make me laugh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jacobs goes on to question whether self-preservation should be the strongest driver of choosing leaders and public policy. He asks whether Christians who so clearly prioritize their interests over those of others can be considered reliable witnesses for faith in Christ. The Christian faith <strong>explicitly</strong> condemns putting one’s own needs above their neighbors. When asked which is the greatest commandments, Jesus responds in clear terms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He replied, “You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your being, and with all your mind.” “ This is the first and greatest commandment.” “ And the second is like it: You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.” (Matthew 22:37-39, CEB)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much has been made of tribalism within the group of Christians who support the current president without reservation. It is evident, by the treatment we have seen of other populations, such as immigrants, that this administration is not concerned about our neighbors. The desire to strengthen the hand of such a leader, to that of a king, speaks of a lack of faith in anything other than despotism.</p>

<p>I saw my first show at a club in 1993, at the venerable Local 506, on Franklin St. in Chapel Hill. The venue is still there, nestled snugly between two Indian restaurants. Now I typically go to see a band there every couple of years or so. At that initial show, I saw Polvo, with the classic lineup of Ash Bowie, Dave Brylawski, Steve Popson and Eddie Watkins. My first rock show was supposed to be seeing Mudhoney the previous year, at the 9:30 Club in DC, where my cousin worked. However, my dad strongly objected to me going to what he just thought of as a bar to see a grunge band. He was intransigent on the subject, and it was out of my hands. I had to wait a bit longer to experience eardrum pounding indie rock in the dark confines of a club.</p>
<p>Polvo was brilliant and raw that night, and left me with a taste for move live music. Polvo remained on of my favorite bands through the 90’s (I also love their more recent records), though drummer Eddie Watkins left the group after the 1996 <em>Exploded Drawing</em> double-LP. That record is considered by many to be the best math rock album ever made. <em>Exploded Drawing</em> effectively showcased the many different sides of Polvo, from the Eastern influences, to the unusual time signatures and unpredictable song structures in an almost grinding journey through the essence of the band. It was certainly a fitting last act with the group for an unusually gifted drummer.</p>
<p>Fast forward 23 years, to 2016, and I found myself employed in the same office with Watkins. I never even knew I was working with one of  my favorite drummers. I’m not sure why I didn&rsquo;t make the connection, since I should have recognized him and he was in a fairly senior role, so I heard his name around. To be fair, we did work on separate products and in different parts of the organization. I didn’t realize it was the same Eddie Watkins, that is, until I came into work one Monday morning and read an email about his death. I was frozen by the news. The cause of death was not specified, which usually means one of only a few options. What I found out independently confirmed my suspicions that Eddie had taken his own life. His family had wanted to keep it quiet initially, but by the following year had started Eddiefest, <a href="https://catscradle.com/event/eddiefest-2019/">an event held at the Cat’s Cradle club</a>, featuring a host of local bands. The third such event was just held.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In honor of late drummer, friend, son, brother and father Eddie Watkins, his family created EddieFest, the first in 2017.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A benefit to bring awareness about suicide and suicide prevention.</p>

<p>I’m glad to see the family taking the opportunity to memorialize Eddie in a way that contributes to the cause of preventing such tragedies.</p>
<h2 id="movember">Movember</h2>
<p><img src="http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2020/9d735f4cca.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://us.movember.com/about/foundation">The Movember Foundation</a> started in 2003 with a mission to improve men’s health and focused on male-specific cancers. The method the charity used was to enlist men to grow mustaches (which had fallen out of favor) in the month of November. The gimmick gave men participating the chance to explain the cause to those asking about the new whiskers. What began as a simple but clever idea has expanded over time. In recent years, they have increased their mission to feature a significant focus on men’s mental health and suicide prevention.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://us.movember.com/story/view/id/11895/new-research-shows-ongoing-stigma-around-talking-about-mental-health-at-work">recent post</a> from the foundation cites research that shows ongoing perceived stigma around talking about mental health at work. 75% of suicides in the US are committed by men. One has to wonder, if it were easier to talk about these issues at work, would we be losing less men in this way? In the wake of Eddie’s suicide, a number of leaders wondered if they had missed signs. What could we have done differently?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have easy answers to the questions about why choose to end their own lives at such a high rate, but I have been <a href="https://moteam.co/never-destroyed">participating in Movember</a> for the last few years to try and raise money and awareness about the problem. I’m hoping that bringing this topic out in the open is a good first step.</p>

<p>Manuel Riess (@hutaffe) <a href="https://hutaffe.blog/2019/11/08/time-to-go.html">recently wrote a bit</a> about returning from Apple Music to Spotify. His dissatisfaction centers around music discovery, hearing new material from artists that the system already should know he likes, and the <em>New Music</em> playlist.</p>
<p>I have had some of the same frustrations. The <em>New Music</em> playlist, which is updated every Friday, used to be something to which I looked forward, at the end of the week. Lately, though, it almost seems like artists (or labels) have been paying to have their music featured on the lists of listeners. How else could you explain Apple Music putting Mariah Carey in the pole position on one of my playlists? There are a few such examples of deep pocket artists showing up on my lists for no discernible reason.  Ever since this started occurring, I can’t trust much of the content on the list. If it’s not by a band with which I’m already familiar, I’m reticent to spend my time checking it out.</p>
<p>With the <em>New Music</em> playlist, Apple should definitely be showing me new tunes by bands that I listen to a lot. That would be low hanging fruit, an easy thing for them to accomplish with the data they have on my listening habits. Instead, I’m not guaranteed to see new releases by my favorite bands. The service just simply doesn’t do a good job of discovery in that space.</p>
<p>Federico Viticci had <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/how-i-keep-track-of-new-music-releases/">a recent piece in Macstories</a> pondering some of the same issues with music discovery in the Apple Music service.</p>

<p>The ‘New Music Mix’ playlist is not terrible, but it often comes loaded with stale data – songs I’ve already listened to multiple times and which shouldn’t qualify as “new” weeks after their original release date. Furthermore, I’ve found notifications for new releases for artists in my library unreliable at best: I <em>occasionally</em> get notifications for new albums, but never for new singles or EPs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ticci’s solution is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor-track-new-music/id1440405750">Music Harbor</a>, an app that keeps you up-to-date with new releases by artists you like. His assessment, as well as the reviews of the app, make it look very promising. However, I just can’t get past the fact that I would need a separate app to do the things Apple Music should be able to do with my existing data.</p>

<li>That I setup a Disney+ subscription. This shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard.</li>
<li>That I stop watching the new Tennis video on repeat. That one is going to be tougher.</li>

<p>The husband and wife duo that comprise Tennis wrote this song while living on a boat, anchored in a fisherman&rsquo;s cove, armed only with an acoustic guitar and a drum sequencer. The recorded version, however, is fully fleshed out and bubbling with synthesizers. The video is simply hypnotic. This is a trance from which I never want to come out.</p>

			 <p>Next week, Instagram is set to begin hiding like counts on posts in the US, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/08/instagram-hide-likes-us/">this TechCrunch piece</a>. The move is expected to hurt influencers on the platform, as initial tests in other countries showed that likes on posts went down when the counts were not displayed. The influencer economy is supposed to be a big part of what drives the platform.  The speculation is that anything that hurts those influencers and their ability to use Instagram to build their businesses too badly will be rolled back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not completely bought into the idea that influencers are as strong a driver of engagement on Instagram as they are assumed to be, but to be fair, I haven&rsquo;t looked deeply at the data. However, I know that the move will be good for teenagers who view posts as popularity contests and delete photos when they don&rsquo;t achieve a certain like count, for fear of embarrassment. I appreciate the fact that those who are steering the Instagram ship are taking steps that account for the mental health of its users.</p>

			 <p>🎵 The patron saints of indie pop, The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, have broken up. I can&rsquo;t pretend that I&rsquo;m not bummed out by this news. I enjoyed all of their records, right up to, and including, the full-length cover of Tom Petty&rsquo;s <em>Full Moon Fever</em>. I had hoped they would have a couple more albums in them before unplugging the guitar cables for good. A more derivative band I don&rsquo;t think I can honestly name, but what was it that was said about great artists stealing? The Pains combined their many influences into a sound that you don&rsquo;t hear much anymore.</p>
<p>Kip Berman, the band&rsquo;s principal, made the announcement <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4cv7SklRwq/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">via Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Since the rotating cast of characters ended up in so many other great bands, it was cool to see Kip call them out in &ldquo;what are they up to now?&rdquo; style.</p>

			 <p>Two years ago, in 2017, was the 500th anniversary of the Reformation. For those of us in the reformed tradition, it was a pretty big deal. This Sunday, we celebrate our annual “Reformation Sunday” in the Presbyterian Church.</p>
<p>Internet Monk recently had a repost from the late Michael Spencer, <a href="https://internetmonk.com/archive/88913">on the Reformation</a>. Spencer studied the Reformation extensively. Though he remained a proud Protestant, he also came away with some pretty frank observations and critiques of either the Reformation movement itself or the way we have come to view it.</p>
<p>The post contains a list of insights (is it a listicle?) that came to Spencer during his studies. Here are some that particularly resonated with me.</p>
<ul>
<li>I do not believe true Christianity was restored or rediscovered in the Reformation.</li>
<li>I’m convinced that it didn’t take long for Protestantism to accumulate enough problems of its own to justify another reformation or two.</li>
<li>I believe that a lot of Protestants say sola scriptura when they mean solo scriptura or nuda scriptura or something I don’t believe at all.</li>
<li>I now believe that tradition is a very good word.</li>
<li>I believe the Reformation was very secular, political and, eventually, quite violent. To act as if it was mostly a spiritual revival movement is naive.</li>
<li>I believe we ought to grieve the division of Christianity and the continuing division of Protestantism.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would also tend to agree with Spencer that, after consistently saying the Apostles Creed, and confessing belief in the one catholic church, it does seem a bit odd to be celebrating Christian division.</p>

<p><strong>It has never been a better time to quit Facebook</strong>, after the company recently revealed a policy that formalized the ability of politicians to lie in ads on the platform. Techcrunch writer Josh Costine called the move <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/pawn-not-platform/">a disgorgement of responsibility</a>. The web publication <a href="http://social.techcrunch.com/2019/10/13/ban-facebook-campaign-ads/">has another piece</a> by Costine, calling on Facebook, and other tech companies, to ban political ads altogether. The ban would hold until they can come up with a coherent policy that doesn’t erode democratic freedoms by inundating the populace with misinformation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No one wants historically untrustworthy social networks becoming the honesty police, deciding what’s factual enough to fly. But the alternative of allowing deception to run rampant is unacceptable. Until voter-elected officials can implement reasonable policies to preserve truth in campaign ads, the tech giants should go a step further and refuse to run them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The formalization of the policy accepting misinformation in ads came after the campaign of Joe Biden called on Facebook to remove ads promoting false claims about him that were made by the Trump campaign. Facebook refused to take the ads down, abdicating any responsibility for their veracity.</p>
<p>In response, the campaign of Elizabeth Warren posted an ad blatantly lying about Mark Zuckerberg endorsing Donald Trump.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook’s ad platform to see if it’d be approved. It got approved quickly and the ad is now running on Facebook.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
 <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Costine writes, in the TechCrunch piece, that “It’s easy to imagine campaign ads escalating into an arms race of dishonesty.”</p>
<p>I’ve always stayed away from Facebook, watching from the sidelines as the company has made a series of bad decisions, every one seemingly worse than the previous. However, I did go back to Instagram a couple of years ago after quitting when they were originally purchased by Facebook.  Now, I am now rethinking my relationship with that platform, especially after my recent push to consolidate my web presence at my own site. I am under no illusions that as many people would go to my personal site to see my photos as see them on Instagram, but more limited exposure seems a reasonable price to pay for principles. After all, I’m not selling anything.</p>

<p><strong>In a break from my normal habit of avoiding hot takes and only sticking to what is room temperature or below, I wanted to write a bit about the uproar of the week.</strong> Specifically, the NBA, that proud bastion of social justice rebellion in recent times, ceding their moral high ground for the irresistible attraction of oodles of Chinese yuan.</p>
<p>Part of the name of this weblog has to do with my intention of capturing ideas being echoed around the blogosphere and there have been many people weighing in on this subject on their blogs. <a href="https://micro.blog/ayjay">@ayjay</a> took on the subject is several blog posts, <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/i-can-see-clearly-now/">like this one</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If nothing else, this whole shameful display should put an end, once and for all, to the ridiculous idea that there is some natural and intrinsic connection between democracy and capitalism. There very obviously ain’t. When shareholders and the bottom line are not benefitted by democracy, then democracy gets flushed down the toilet. American big business has firmly decided for a totalitarian regime and against people who want democratic freedoms. The business of America really <em>is</em> business after all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote, and the piece, are not just centered on the NBA, but also around ESPN/Disney and Apple, as well. After all, many corporations that are making grand gestures for social justice are also heavily entrenched in a totalitarian state that has over a million <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/china-calls-it-re-education-but-uyghur-muslims-say-its-unbearable-brutality">people in concentration camps</a>.</p>
<p>Along with the increased scrutiny over where these companies choose to exercise their influence come some pretty fair questions about proportionality. Jason Morehead has <a href="https://opuszine.us/posts/nba-broken-wokeness">a nice round up</a> of opinion pieces about how many companies have fought hard for progressive causes domestically suddenly grow mute when much larger human rights abuses are committed in countries in which they do big business.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s almost like trusting American corporations to do what’s morally right, not just when it’s easy and results in good PR but also when it’s inconvenient, unpopular, and they risk losing lots of money, is a bad idea. Who knew?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple has no problem <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/has-apple-legally/">filing an amicus brief against a cake maker</a>, but don’t expect them to risk a kink in their massive supply chain anytime soon, no matter how righteous the cause.</p>
<p>This issue isn’t even limited to private corporations, though. The state of New York joined the NBA in boycotting North Carolina over bathroom provisioning, while also almost simultaneously <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2017/03/09/new-york-senate-passes-anti-bds-bills">making is just short of illegal to boycott other countries</a> for human rights violations.  How one state can reconcile boycotting another state over bathrooms while seriously restricting the right to protest, say, people’s houses being bulldozed in <em>another country</em>, I’m not sure I will ever understand. This all happening under the auspices of a constitution that guarantees the right to free speech makes everything even more ridiculous.</p>

<h3 id="taking-a-bite-out-of-apple">Taking a bite out of Apple</h3>
<p>Returning to the issue of uneven corporate activism, it starts to get difficult to determine exactly what a conscientious consumer is to make of his or her options. Picking up with Alan Jacobs again, who <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/ethical-evaluation/">has a post</a> that wrestles with how to handle the ethical implications of Apple’s decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The other axis, that of ethics, is even more difficult. Apple’s Chinese entanglements massive compromise the ethical status of the company, and in more than one way. (Which is worse, obedience to the demands of the Chinese government or the exploitation of Chinese labor?) But Apple also deserves some praise for its commitment to privacy and its truly wonderful work  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqoXFCCTfm4">in making its computers accessible to a wide range of users</a>. I don’t know how to make an ethics spreadsheet, as it were, that assembles all the relevant factors — including comparisons to the available alternatives — and gives them proper weighting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that Apple is a particularly tough case here, because in so many areas (tablets, for example), there are simply no credible competitors. That’s not meant to be a commentary simply on the Apple products themselves, but also upon the ecosystem that exists around them. There is a very real paucity of third party software on other platforms, mostly because people using Android and Windows don’t tend to be software enthusiasts, who are willing to pay for well done products by independent shops.</p>
<p>My wife asked a good question regarding Apple, as we shopped for a new tablet that she can use for work: <em>“How do you hold them to account, when your power is your purchasing power?”</em></p>

			 <p>It’s good to see early results in some experiments with universal basic income. I’m especially interested in seeing how can the implementation of such programs can break the cycle of poverty.</p>
<p>In Stockton, CA, those who qualified for the program <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/10/stockton-universal-basic-income-pilot-economic-empowerment/599152/">were given $500 a month</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After talking to researchers and social workers about the program, Paradela felt a little more confident. And when the money finally showed up that first month, “it came just in time,” she said: Her car battery had died, and she needed money to fix it. A few months later, her car was hit by a driver making an illegal U-turn. If the vehicle stayed out of commission, she wouldn’t be able to get to work, or visit her mother in the hospital down in Hollister.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alleviating the stress of the unknowns that can put someone into a viscous cycle is a laudable goal in itself. That alone seems like something that could have a huge impact in quality of life for those who are just getting by.</p>

			 <p>In the <a href="https://mailchi.mp/om.co/the-consumerism-curse-the-apple-chip-tesla-great-reads?e=5cfe32d18e">latest issue of his newsletter</a>, Om Malik writes about consumerism being one of the harder habits to beat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But there is one demon I have not been able to conquer, an addiction that is worse than nicotine: consumerism. For the past four years, every year, I make an effort to get rid of things and buy less. It is not easy to do — the machines of desire work constantly and are powerful. I looked at my own spending trends, and I am at about 25 percent of where I was four years ago. I have bought much fewer things and gotten rid of an average of 10 things a month. And yet, it is not enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason I refer to myself as a &ldquo;aspiring minimalist&rdquo; in my bio. Acquisition of material goods can be a difficult thing on which to scale back. For one, it’s such a general goal to tackle, unlike even something such as improving eating habits. Though you may cut back on a certain area of discretionary spending, such as a hobby, it can be harder yet to spend less on what seem like necessities, like clothing.</p>
<p>Malik addresses quite a bit of the piece to clothing specifically. He refers to the amount of clothing that goes to landfills after not being sold. H&amp;M alone <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/h-m-profit-plunges-to-16-year-low-as-clothing-chain-loses-allure">has burned $4.3 billion worth of excess inventory</a>. Personally, I wouldn’t mind if H&amp;M burned 99% of their clothing, but that’s a topic for another blog post.</p>

			 <p>With the start of the football season, there are many who are questioning whether they should continue to support the sport and the NFL. <a href="https://micro.blog/mgs">@mgs</a> had <a href="https://500ish.com/bets-against-football-bets-on-it-5d564e743c60?source=rss----662a29c3b19e---4">this post</a> on the subject of the upcoming season.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have very mixed feelings about watching football these days. On one hand, it’s without question the best of the major US sports to watch on television. On the other, it’s an absolutely barbaric sport. Many of the players playing today will suffer injuries playing the game which they will never recover from. And many of the people who are supposed to be in charge of the league are seemingly immoral. It’s perhaps not as bad as watching boxing in decades past. Or actual gladiators in centuries past. But it’s also not entirely different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, in my view, too many people (my son included) are making the same choice that Siegler ultimately makes, which is to throw out any misgivings and just keep on watching.</p>
<p>I think Augustine would have agreed with the gladiator reference. He writes the following, of his friend Alypius, in the sixth book of his <em>Confessions</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He, not forsaking that secular course which his parents had charmed him to pursue, had gone before me to Rome, to study law, and there he was carried away incredibly with an incredible eagerness after the shows of gladiators. For being utterly averse to and detesting such spectacles, he was one day by chance met by divers of his acquaintance and fellow-students coming from dinner, and they with a familiar violence haled him, vehemently refusing and resisting, into the Amphitheatre, during these cruel and deadly shows, he thus protesting: “Though you hale my body to that place, and there set me, can you force me also to turn my mind or my eyes to those shows? I shall then be absent while present, and so shall overcome both you and them.” They hearing this, led him on nevertheless, desirous perchance to try that very thing, whether he could do as he said. When they were come thither, and had taken their places as they could, the whole place kindled with that savage pastime. But he, closing the passages of his eyes, forbade his mind to range abroad after such evils; and would he had stopped his ears also! For in the fight, when one fell, a mighty cry of the whole people striking him strongly, overcome by curiosity, and as if prepared to despise and be superior to it whatsoever it were, even when seen, he opened his eyes, and was stricken with a deeper wound in his soul than the other, whom he desired to behold, was in his body; and he fell more miserably than he upon whose fall that mighty noise was raised, which entered through his ears, and unlocked his eyes, to make way for the striking and beating down of a soul, bold rather than resolute, and the weaker, in that it had presumed on itself, which ought to have relied on Thee. For so soon as he saw that blood, he therewith drunk down savageness; nor turned away, but fixed his eye, drinking in frenzy, unawares, and was delighted with that guilty fight, and intoxicated with the bloody pastime. Nor was he now the man he came, but one of the throng he came unto, yea, a true associate of theirs that brought him thither.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There may not be a mass market for minimalist phones — they’re expensive, they’re superfluous, they’re extra — but there could be niche markets for the Light Phone: well-to-do campers, weekend warriors, the hyper-wired looking for relief. That could also include, as one friend put it, “people who shouldn’t be trusted with smartphones”: children, old people, and bad teens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like how “bad teens” are included in those who may be in need of a really expensive phone that doesn’t do much. What about “bad old people?”</p>
<p>I do love those e-ink screens, though&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A year ago we focused, ostensibly, on the Bible and what God wanted to tell us. Now we are concerned with the financial health and wealth of young families, how to raise children, how to keep a marriage vital, how to be good friends, and stuff like that. Sort of like classes you might take at a community center.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve heard similar comments from others who have attended newer churches. They feel like the churches are advertising for addiction recovery programs or spiritual wellness or simply bringing people together in community. While all of those ministries are important, churches that are lacking in strong Christian theology <em>might as well</em> serve as alternate community centers.</p>

<p>A great many people think they’re interested in politics when they’re only interested in news. I have in recent years grown more and more interested in politics and economics, which is to say, the whole long history of all the ways in which we human beings have tried to live together without killing one another but instead, perhaps, finding some arena of mutual benefit. I think our current obsession with news makes it far harder for us to think about politics, so I have stepped away from the daily grind of “And Now This!” to try to inquire into the principles of political economy, and politics more generally.</p>

<p>Feedbin has had top notch integration with Twitter for some time, allowing you to follow users as if they had RSS feeds (which Twitter did have, in the early days). For tweets with links, Feedbin includes the content of the article to which the tweet links.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2019/f0a987a805.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Feedbin also includes handy buttons for viewing the Twitter conversation without leaving the app, or for opening the  tweet in the Twitter app on iOS (useful for replying).</p>
<p>Some of my favorite users to follow on Twitter are those that provide links to good content. Of course, the title of this post was somewhat facetious, as many people use Twitter in different ways. For me, though, using Twitter through Feedbin feels ideal. The opportunity to get great content from those who use the platform as their primary sharing mechanism, without having to get swept away by the stream, is immensely valuable.</p>

			 <p>In a piece entitled <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2012/12/15/our-moloch/">Our Moloch</a>, written just after the Sandy Hook shootings, Garry Wills compares the American love for guns to the ancient worship of the god Moloch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gun is not a mere tool, a bit of technology, a political issue, a point of debate. It is an object of reverence. Devotion to it precludes interruption with the sacrifices it entails. Like most gods, it does what it will, and cannot be questioned. Its acolytes think it is capable only of good things. It guarantees life and safety and freedom. It even guarantees law. Law grows from it. Then how can law question it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the comparison seems hyperbolic, consider this: In the Presbyterian Church that I attend, we host meetings for Mom’s Demand Action. However, we can’t list the meeting in our church bulletin, without changing the name. To admit that you are following Christian teaching, even when it goes against a love for unrestricted access to guns, is to commit a uniquely American heresy. To further illustrate the point, Mom’s Demand Action advocates for safety measures that were first developed by the National Rifle Association in the 1980’s. In that era, the NRA still allowed discussion of gun regulations to an extent that seems unfathomable now.</p>
<p>The worship of Moloch is one of the ugliest traditions depicted in the Old Testament of the Bible. When the text refers to the “detestable practices” that were common among the people with whom the Israelites lived, ritual prostitution and burning children in sacrifice to the god Moloch are chief among those practices. One of the most visceral scenes I have ever read in a novel comes from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1290">Salammbo, by Gustave Flaubert</a>. In the book, the citizens of the ancient city of Carthage are trying stave off invasion by the angry and unpaid mercenaries who helped them to fight against the Roman Empire. The water supply to the city has been cut and they are in dire need of rain. In their desperation, the Carthaginians hastily sacrifice their children to the fires of a giant idol of Moloch. It’s a difficult scene to stomach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The victims, when scarcely at the edge of the opening, disappeared like a drop of water on a red-hot plate, and white smoke rose amid the great scarlet colour.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the appetite of the god was not appeased. He ever wished for more. In order to furnish him with a larger supply, the victims were piled up on his hands with a big chain above them which kept them in their place. Some devout persons had at the beginning wished to count them, to see whether their number corresponded with the days of the solar year; but others were brought, and it was impossible to distinguish them in the giddy motion of the horrible arms. This lasted for a long, indefinite time until the evening. Then the partitions inside assumed a darker glow, and burning flesh could be seen. Some even believed that they could descry hair, limbs, and whole bodies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the Sandy Hook shootings, there was a lack of legislative, or really any, action that followed. Many said that if we allowed this sort of thing to happen to our children without doing anything about it, we would never have the will to prevent these things. So far, those people who predicted our sinful complacency have been right. While other countries take action and are rewarded with safer communities in which to live, we in America continue to trade our security, and that of our children, to curry favor with the false god of unrestricted access to weapons.</p>

			 <p>In the continuing saga of anecdotal evidence that our healthcare system is badly in need of repair, <a href="https://micro.blog/ayjay">@ayjay</a> offers <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/great/">this story</a> from his son.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday my son, who works in the Chicago Loop, saw a woman on a bicycle get hit by a car. She wasn’t seriously injured, but she was knocked to the ground, dazed. He ran up to her to see if she was okay and pulled out his phone to call 911 — but she quickly, urgently said, “No! No! I can’t afford to go to the hospital!” And after taking a moment to gather herself, she got to her feet, picked up her damaged bike, and wobbled off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They do say that the plural of anecdote is data. Of course, with regards to healthcare in this country, we shouldn&rsquo;t even need the anecdotes to show how terrible the healthcare situation has become. We&rsquo;ve got mountains of empirical data to do that quite effectively. The human stories do have a power that the faceless data could never convey, though.</p>

			 <p>In the piece, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/07/30/738948062/study-asks-if-war-makes-a-person-more-or-less-religious">Study Asks If War Makes A Person More &hellip; Or Less &hellip; Religious</a>, Diane Cole writes for NPR about the affect being in intense conflict situations has on personal and communal religiosity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more profound the impact of war on an individual — such as the death, injury or abduction of a household member — the greater the likelihood grew of that person turning to religion. By contrast, those who had been less affected by the impact of war were also less likely to join a a religious group. The statistical breakdown showed that for those in Sierra Leone, greater exposure to war made it 12% more likely individuals would turn to religion; 14% more for those in Uganda; and 41% more for Tajikstan.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even as years passed, Henrich&rsquo;s latest study found that religious practice continued to play a significant role in the lives of many of those surveyed. &ldquo;These effects on religiosity persist even 5, 8 and 13 years post-conflict,&rdquo; according to the study. The effects held true whether those surveyed were Muslim or Christian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This research seems to lead credibility to the aphorism, “there are no atheists in foxholes,” although that statement is far from a universal qualifier. As Christopher “Hitch” Hitchens would have told you most vehemently, from the metaphorical foxhole of his terminal cancer diagnosis, there are atheists even in those dark places.</p>
<p>What does this say about the faith impulse, though? The implication from these studies point to it being a psychological survival mechanism. Of course, the war weary are by no means the only keepers of religion, so we probably need to be careful about drawing too many sweeping conclusions about the nature of religious belief.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/highline/article/millennial-nuns/">Why On Earth Are So Many Millennials Becoming Nuns?</a>, Eve Fairbanks examines why millennial women are flocking to religious orders in record numbers. The piece is a fascinating look at how ancient Catholic institutions are faring in contemporary times.</p>
<p>Several women are profiled in the article. One, named Rachael, in part seems to be reacting against the ambiguity of moral relativism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was partly a bitter joke, but partly a sincere thought. “There is nothing consistent in the secular world,” Rachael reflected. Catholicism, by contrast, taught that “truth is a fact.” Your obligations to other people and God couldn&rsquo;t be trumped by your “personal truth.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A portion of the piece focuses on the rising challenge of a more orthodox faith in the face of some failing ideas that were supposed to bring about ​a perfect society. The ways modern, secular life has let us down, from materialism to the existential ache that comes from a lack of meaning, are examined through the lenses of these young women pursuing the cloistered life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are a thing that is wounded, American society. People raised for the new millennium were to be a kind of final proof that democracy and American society was, indeed, the greatest that ever could be made, now that primitive superstitions had been cleared, tech and science and finance reigned, major political threats had fallen and our hegemony seemed complete. We were, and shakily remain, utopian in ways I would laugh at if I hadn’t bought into them, too. More than half of millennials still tell pollsters they believe they’re going to be millionaires. Most of us expected to achieve idyllic marriages, even though so many of our parents had divorced. We were taught that anything you hoped for could be achieved with the right planning, that life is a series of hacks: fabulous tricks, but ones that have a reliable code for how to repeat them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These life hacks have become a sort of pseudo-religious phenomenon, with the appropriate amount of focus and attention given to them. The similarities are not hard to spot once you really look.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things like Goop and the gluten-free movement are basically straight-up religions, promising spiritual renewal and healing from all sickness, only with a jade yoni egg as the Eucharist. We’re fixated on minimalism and self-purification, be it by the methods of Marie Kondo or “inbox zero” or Jordan Peterson, whose popularity rests less on his insights about Carl Jung or lobster biology than on his idea that life can be boiled down to 12 rules—commandments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though much of our culture seems to serve as an incubator for the construction of these neo-pagan paradigms, their escapes by way of the road to religious orders were not without bumps for the subjects of the story. No spoilers here, but being a nun is not an easy thing. As is noted in the article, it&rsquo;s not the frequently thought of chastity that is difficult so much as it is the obedience. A lot of autonomy is lost. Aspects of one&rsquo;s personal identity become subsumed by the group. Of course, those difficulties make the rising  numbers of women trying to become nuns seem all the more reactionary and radical.</p>

			 <p>🍿 <strong>A Little Chaos</strong>: To call a movie that takes place in palatial 17th century French houses and gardens sumptuous may be a bit trite, but if the shoe fits…</p>
<p>The glacial pace of the budding romance between two high-profile gardeners in <em>A Little Chaos</em> leaves plenty of time to admire the scenery. Though the film had a fairly slow pace throughout, and was all the better for it, the end felt a bit rushed to get to the denouement. This was Alan Rickman&rsquo;s last film as a director and certainly a splendid effort overall.</p>

<p>First, he finds many of them fragile when it comes to the Bible. They are fearful and suspicious when approaching scripture. Their first instinct is to find what’s problematic in the Bible. They miss the joy of scripture. They approach it as skeptics first, mistrustful of what they are going to find, already leaning toward a conclusion that the Bible has been used in so many harmful ways over the course of history that one must first deconstruct it before finding anything of value in it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t dispute this phenomena, nor do I find it to be universally true. Chaplain Mike himself being an example of someone deeply attached to scripture. However, he and Beck consider themselves &ldquo;post-progressive&rdquo; and perhaps they have adopted this moniker partially to highlight their biblical fidelity.</p>

<p><strong>I seem to be reading a lot about “influencers” lately.</strong> When I think of influencers, the typical profile that comes to mind is the Instagram star with oodles of followers trading their share of eyeballs for products that are ripe for placement.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/rmcrob">@rmcrob</a> recently posted <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/07/05/this-famed-la-ice-cream-truck-has-started-charging-influencers-double/">a link to an article</a> about an ice cream truck that charges influencers, who try to get free ice cream, in return for exposure, double the cost for some fresh desert.</p>
<p>Though there is something distasteful about how many of these internet celebrities trade fame for product, arguably to the detriment of their audiences, it isn’t really a new thing. This type of trade-off has for some time been proposed in the photography world. Most photographers have come to despise the request for free services to get them exposure, leading to at least <a href="https://pics.onsizzle.com/we-cant-pay-you-but-the-exposure-will-be-great-2946327.png">one clever Oregon Trail meme</a> on the subject.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2019/aeeb498129.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s probably safe to say peddling influence has been around for as long as there has been media. I <a href="https://medium.com/@mineinmono/my-top-five-christmas-movies-b8bb15924947">wrote this</a> about the movie <em>Christmas in Connecticut</em> (1945) in December 2017, when compiling a list of favorite Christmas movies for my brother.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then you find out that the leading female character is a materialistic New York urbanite (played by the delightful Barbara Stanwick) named Elizabeth Lane, who writes a popular folksy column for a magazine under a completely assumed identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In today’s parlance, Lane could be considered part of the “influencer economy,” trading tales about an aspirational lifestyle for product sponsorships. The character doesn’t know how to cook (in fact, she’s got a Hungarian cook named Felix who features prominently for comic relief) but she writes whole features around down-home recipes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/cheri">@cheri</a> recently opined on the subject in <a href="https://www.cheribaker.com/my-problem-with-influencers/">My Problem with Influencers</a>. She starts off of the piece with a David Wallace quote, emphasizing that this trend has been with us for some time, but has only accelerated with the newer outlets for covert advertising.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This passage still feels relevant even though Wallace wrote it in the nineties, long before the rise of social media. Perhaps that’s because the trend of ads-pretending-to-be-other-things has only sped up over the years. As a result, we’re living our lives alongside a bizarre set of social norms that I’ve come to think of as influencer culture. Influencer culture is most visible in the world of advertising, but it trickles into our politics, communities, and nearly all internet-mediated communication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My guess is that we’ve reached some soft of peak influencer period. People are spending a lot of time on YouTube and Instagram, where popularity is mostly self-made. The newly famous on these platforms need or want remuneration for their efforts to gain followers (which can take substantial effort). As long as that holds, advertising, whether obvious or not, will remain a tempting business model.</p>

Sambassadeur’s Swedish indie pop has a kind of gentle forcefulness to it.

<p>In <a href="https://idlewords.com/2019/06/the_new_wilderness.htm">The New Wilderness</a>, Maciej Cegłowski writes about changing views around privacy and how the rules that served us so well in the past didn&rsquo;t take into account the present landscape. Though there are many, the piece is easily one of the best that I&rsquo;ve read on the subject.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the eyes of regulators, privacy still means what it did in the eighteenth century—protecting specific categories of personal data, or communications between individuals, from unauthorized disclosure. Third parties that are given access to our personal data have a duty to protect it, and to the extent that they discharge this duty, they are respecting our privacy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Seen in this light, the giant tech companies can make a credible claim to be the defenders of privacy, just like a dragon can truthfully boast that it is good at protecting its hoard of gold. Nobody spends more money securing user data, or does it more effectively, than Facebook and Google.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is perhaps the first time I’ve heard the large tech companies compared to a character like Smaug from <em>The Hobbit</em>.  The similarities seem obvious, though, with the unchecked acquisitiveness of both the massive tech behemoths and the clever, greedy dragon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question we need to ask is not whether our data is safe, but why there is suddenly so much of it that needs protecting. The problem with the dragon, after all, is not its stockpile stewardship, but its appetite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many insightful angles that Ceglowski hits upon, but I especially appreciate when he points out that Facebook and Google make claims about protecting user privacy with multiple tracking scripts being served by the very articles in which they make these claims. Therein lies part of the answer to why there is now so much data that needs protecting.</p>

			 <p>🎵 <a href="https://youtu.be/I_KDYTprXCg">Sebadoh - Sunshine</a>: I&rsquo;m still deciding how I feel about the majority of the new Sebadoh album, <em>Celebrate The Void</em>. Sebadoh and I have a long history and it has been about 27 years since I heard that the bassist who got kicked out of Dinosaur Jr. had his own band. At the time I nearly flipped my lid. In the fall of 1994, I went to see Sebadoh and Dinosaur Jr. within a week of each other and teased Lou Barlow a bit about it while getting to hang out with him as well as Mike Flood at the merch table (I didn&rsquo;t ride with the flood that night).</p>
<p>Although, it&rsquo;s hard to call such a unique and prolific band &ldquo;consistent,&rdquo; I would maintain that the majority of their records have a sizable number of songs that have stuck closely with me throughout the years. Even the previous record, <em>Defend Yourself</em>, which appeared after a fairly lengthy hiatus, has a couple of tracks that rank among their better material.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to predict how the latest record will age, though. I&rsquo;ve liked it better than I thought I would and the track &ldquo;Sunshine&rdquo; is one reason for that. Barlow&rsquo;s clever lyrics about needing the brighter side of life so he can shut it out speaks  to a part of the human condition that&rsquo;s hard to name or even describe well. The slow and angular guitar part lazily wraps itself around some soothing negative space. The classically and unmistakably Sebadoh baseline anchors the song and gives it a bit of a jaunty feeling. The whole song comes together as a remarkable entry in the band&rsquo;s catalog and makes you glad they are still doing their thing.<br>

			 <p>An excerpt <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2019/06/13/bill-callahan-shepherd-in-a-sheepskin-vest-interview/">from an interview</a> with singer/songwriter Bill Callahan about his new album, which exudes a certain comfort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Do you consider yourself an optimist?</strong></p>
<p>Every day, waking up in the morning fills me with optimism. Everything is moving along. The bugs are doing their thing. Traffic is going on. Everyone’s going to work. Everything’s working, going in one direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind, Callahan has been in some pretty dark places, as even a quick examination of his older albums will show. So it&rsquo;s interesting to read this response. As someone who struggles with mornings sometimes, I love the idea of waking up with this in my mind.</p>
<p>Two songs that sound to me like starting the day in this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Acknowledgment&rdquo; by John Coltrane from <em>A Love Supreme</em></li>
<li>&ldquo;Sunrise&rdquo; from <em>Grand Canyon Suite</em>, composed by Ferde Grofé</li>

			 <p>Like many others, my wife is pretty into true crime podcasts, tv shows and books. She even considers herself to be part of a cult called the Murderinos and she&rsquo;s got the merchandise to prove it. I&rsquo;ve never had a fascination with the macabre, but I&rsquo;ve certainly had a lot of second hand exposure to the genre from living in the same house.</p>
<p>One thing I admit I had not given much thought to, with regard to these stories, is how the families of the victims may feel. Lilly Dancyger, whose cousin Sabina was murdered, <a href="https://crimereads.com/dont-use-my-family-for-your-true-crime-stories/">vents her frustration</a> with people making entertainment out of these tragedies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody has tried to make entertainment out of Sabina’s story, but if they did, I would burn their podcast studio to the ground. I would call them every night at 3 a.m, and then again at 5, and when they started turning their phone off I would show up and ring the doorbell. I would dig up their most embarrassing secrets and use them as blackmail. I would do whatever I had to do to get them to give up on the project. It would be intolerable to me—physically intolerable like the way a body can’t tolerate rotten oysters—for someone to splash Sabina’s last moments and the horror of her death onto a TV screen, or to narrate it between advertisements for Casper mattresses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>​Elsewhere in the article, Dancyger adopts a more conciliatory tone, but she still poses some pretty tough questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t begrudge true crime fans their shows. I’m not here to tell you you’re a bad person if you enjoy these stories. But I wish that the audiences and creators of these shows would give a little extra thought to how the dead woman (because it’s almost always a woman) at the heart of the story is treated in the telling. Is she treated like a human being who had more life left to live, with people who loved her, who will never be the same because of her loss? Or is she reduced to a gory crime scene photo and a plot point in a story about a man who doesn’t deserve anyone’s fascination?</p>

			 <p>🍿 <strong>Paterson</strong>: This movie is a delightful celebration of the ordinary. Adam Driver plays Paterson, a bus driver in Paterson, NJ (purely a coincidence) who writes poetry. As he goes about his routine, navigating his daily route, drinking a single beer at the same bar every night, he finds art in the details. It reminds me of the Flaubert quote:
&ldquo;Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work.&rdquo; Only, without the violence.</p>
<p>Paterson&rsquo;s relationship with his wife also endeared this film to me. Laura paints everything black and white and dreams simultaneously of having a successful cupcake business and being a country music star like Patsy Cline. Paterson embraces her ambitions with a mix of mild amusement and supportiveness. She dreams big while he downplays his poetic skill.</p>

			 <p>🎵<a href="https://youtu.be/qs--LdnI5jk">Sleater-Kinney - Hurry on Home</a>: This summer seems to be rushing in with a burst of music characterized by youthful energy, even when the performers themselves don&rsquo;t necessarily fit the youthful profile. Sleater-Kinney has returned from dormancy, like the aughts never happened, with a new track fits right in with the wave of high-octane indie rock. It is jolting. Though it’s over-too-soon, the track unwraps a dense package of sounds in its less than 3 minutes of life.</p>
<p>The cover of the single, while ridiculous and not even completely safe for work, feels like an homage to Carrie Browstein’s other life as a comedian, stubbornly refusing to take herself too seriously.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2019/05/20/less-bullets-more.html">I wrote recently</a> about how my bullet journal is becoming more of a traditional journal now. It also serves as a common-place book for various bits of information. <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/john-lockes-method-for-common-place-books-1685/">This post from Public Domain Review</a> goes into detail about how John Locke organized his common-place book and briefly reflects on how the glut of information that was a consequence of the printing press made such books popular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the rise of printing technologies, common-place books reflected an anxiety with a deluge of new information still present today. John Locke was concerned with not just how to access it, but how to organise and recall it. In the age of the internet, as Steven Johnson writes, we are equally led into “common places”, where associations are constructed through happenstance (e.g. from a Google search); our job, he adds, is to sort that information out whilst also enabling connections to germinate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was particularly impressed with Locke&rsquo;s way of indexing by using each of the letters of the alphabet, then assigning the 5 vowels to each of them. Using his method, pages that contained info related to blogging would be indexed under the B with the O secondary. It&rsquo;s a rather ingenious way of organizing scraps of information. You just have to remember how you classified each discrete bit of data.</p>

<p>The New Yorker recently featured an article from Cal Newport entitled <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/can-indie-social-media-save-us">Can “Indie” Social Media Save Us?</a> that generated a lot of interest and responses from the IndieWeb community. The focus of the piece was whether the rise of the IndieWeb and decentralized social media services could help to mitigate some of the problems that have come from the corporate social media networks. Ultimately, Newport concludes that the IndieWeb will never reach the popularity of the current social media spaces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite its advantages, however, I suspect that the IndieWeb will not succeed in replacing existing social-media platforms at their current scale. For one thing, the IndieWeb lacks the carefully engineered addictiveness that helped fuel the rise of services like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This addictiveness has kept people returning to their devices even when they know there are better uses for their time; remove the addiction, and you might lose the users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately for those that love the IndieWeb, social networks thrive on economies of scale, and the corporate networks tend to have the advantage there. On <a href="https://fireside.fm/s/vRGMgKkJ+YtDRu3oy">the most recent episode of the Internet Friends podcast</a>, Drew and Jon discuss leaving Twitter and coming back again. The discussion includes some vague references to using another social network service, which I believe is Micro.blog, and how that experience wasn’t as valuable or enjoyable as using Twitter. I have heard others express this frustration, mostly for the simple reason that the corporate social networks like Twitter and Instagram are where most people are found.</p>
<p>I actually prefer Micro.blog to Twitter, though it was never meant to be a direct competitor or to match all of the features or scale (that’s why M.b. includes cross posting to networks like Twitter). Micro.blog is slower, but also more considered.  <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/indie-web-in-the-new-yorker/">Alan Jacobs believes</a> the speculation that the Indie Web will not overrun the established networks in number of users is a good thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just one point for now: Newport writes, “Despite its advantages, however, I suspect that the IndieWeb will not succeed in replacing existing social-media platforms at their current scale.” This is precisely right, but as I commented a few weeks ago, that’s a feature, not a bug. Scale is the enemy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I stumbled upon Micro.blog, I was looking for an minimal, markdown-centric means of blogging. I started on the network with the “blog like a hacker” approach of using Jekyll on GitHub pages and later switched over to the hosted plan. The social aspect of M.b. was a bonus. The M.b. network presented a built in group of people who, unlike many on Twitter, were interested in, and had the attention span needed to read 500 word blog posts.</p>
<p>Manton Reece, the man behind Micro.blog, in response to the Newport piece, <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/05/20/more-on-the.html">elaborates on one of the premises that drives the network.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s okay to have centralized services to make things easier for people, because it’s too much to expect that everyone should run their own server. The web can be “spread out” on multiple layers: a more diverse set of platforms, so that not all the power is concentrated in a couple massive platforms like Facebook; and more personal domain names, so that even if Micro.blog hosts 1000s of blogs, each one has its own identity on the web and can be moved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of a portable identity is a big part of the value proposition of the IndieWeb and blogging in general. You can switch platforms and still keep your writing and your domain name. Depending on the specifics of the platform switch and the design implications, your readers may never even know you are using a different service. There is a consistency as well as a method of true ownership of your content. Popular blogger Khoi Vinh <a href="https://ownyourcontent.wordpress.com/2019/05/14/khoi-vinh-on-how-his-blog-amplified-his-work-and-career/">expounds on how ownership and the platform</a> you use helps to distinguish your work from the rest of the stuff in the stream.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That said, I personally can’t imagine handing over all of my labor to a centralized platform where it’s chopped up and shuffled together with content from countless other sources, only to be exploited at the current whims of the platform owners’ volatile business models. I know a lot of creators are successful in that context, but I also see a lot of stuff that gets rendered essentially indistinguishable from everything else, lost in the blizzard of “content.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2019/8265827624.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Though I wholeheartedly wish for a return to the days when it took some amount of effort to put your thoughts on the internet, I am skeptical that many will turn to the IndieWeb. Despite the problems of the centralized social networks, people don’t seem to be turning away from them in massive numbers. Though it’s getting easier to join, thanks to networks like Mastodon and Micro.blog, the IndieWeb still has a ways to go before it will be appealing to your average internet denizen. Even if people leave Facebook and Twitter, there is no guarantee they will join the IndieWeb. As Newport writes in the original piece, users fed up with the existing social networks may abandon the concept of internet-based social networks all together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a technology enthusiast, I’m a believer in the IndieWeb movement and think it will play an important role in the future of the Internet. For the exhausted majority of social-media users, however, the appeal of the proverbial quiet bench might outweigh the lure of a better Facebook.</p>

			 <p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2019/8033113433.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>I started the year 2019 with another respectable bullet journal (bujo), crafted from a Moleskine notebook and made to get things done.</strong> Something went awry along the way to filling that notebook, though.</p>
<p>The problems begin when I realized, as in other years, I was going to have far less tasks than notebook. Something seemed slightly tragic about having a perfectly good notebook with so much space going to waste. The bullet journal system doesn&rsquo;t encourage traditional journaling, so much as it does creating action items and systems to develop habits. Sure, it has built-in support for plain notes, but those feel like they are mostly to be used in conjunction with bullets for actions. With more in my head than just what task I needed to accomplish next, I began to explore more traditional journal entries that in years past might have been done in a digital format such as the <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/">Day One app</a>.</p>
<p>I have systems in place to limit my screen time after 9pm, which has proven to be a good thing, so it made more sense to be writing journal entries on good old-fashioned paper. I started off slow, at first. Then, as difficulties in my everyday life mounted, the journal entries became more frequent. Those entries outnumbered the action item bullets. I tend to find that, for me, the notion of productivity for its own sake goes right out of the window in the face of medical problems and unexpected life disruptions. My incomplete todo&rsquo;s from March still look at me and laugh from the page. The best laid plans (well, maybe not the best) of mice and men&hellip;</p>
<p>In fact, it would be pretty easy to look at my journal and determine when introspection became more important than productivity. Gauging how each day was going, whether things were improving and reflecting on overcoming past difficulties took priority over tallying up a list of things I was getting done. It happens. Life occasionally gets in the way of progress and sometimes taking a step back to reflect is more necessary than moving forward on the next goal. Sometimes moving forward is not even possible without that act of reflection. Other times, with various things competing for time and mental energy, forward progress is not even  possible until a later, more stable, time.</p>
<p>As I fill my Moleskine, I’m trying to stay mindful of the rightful place of productivity in my thinking, in my life and even in my bujo. My identity is more than just what I can get done in a day. I think it’s fair to say that my effectiveness as a father, husband, teacher, co-worker, or any other hat I wear is greater than simply my productivity. After all, as Austin Kleon explains <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2018/01/05/getting-things-done/">in this post</a> from last year, productivity is not the same as effectiveness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve gotten a handful of tweets recently asking me about “productivity systems,” which is funny to me because it assumes I do any thinking at  all about <em>productivity</em>. Productivity is pretty low on my list of cares. “Productivity is for machines, not for people,” Jason Fried recently <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/936991970395938816">tweeted</a>. “Think about how effective you’re being, not how productive you’re being.”</p>

In its early days, the once ubiquitous soda 7UP contained the mood stabilizing element lithium.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first thing to know about lithium to understand its strange place in the history of psychiatry is that, unlike all the other drugs, it wasn&rsquo;t invented in a laboratory. It&rsquo;s an element. It&rsquo;s found in the natural world. And it&rsquo;s found, for example, in certain kinds of spas in Europe that, in the past, bragged about the high lithium content of their drinking water. And so it had a place in spa culture. It had a place as a feel-good tonic. It was, for a period of time, an ingredient in a new lemon-lime soft drink that became quite popular up through the 1950s that gets renamed 7UP [which doesn&rsquo;t contain lithium today].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Frequently, people know that Coca-Cola used to contain cocaine, but I have never heard that 7UP once contained lithium.</p>

			 <p>I have been following the health status of, and praying for, Rachel Held Evans recently, as she lay in a coma induced to keep her brain from constant seizures. Yesterday, <a href="https://rachelheldevans.com/blog/health-updates">Evans passed away</a>, after a fight to keep her alive following an ordeal that started with a reaction to antibiotics.</p>
<p>As word of Evans death spread through the internet, many expressed their shock and grief. A number of those people also wrote about how she inspired them to take bold steps in their lives, to walk in faith. There was something about the way she made people feel comfortable with doubt, and processing that as a normal part of a faith journey, that resonated with a lot of Christians. She particularly strengthened those who felt cast out by their church experiences.</p>
<p>Evans was noted for her <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/rachel-held-evans-the-hugely-popular-evangelical-writer-is-dead-at-37.html">disagreements with prominent evangelical leaders</a>, but it seems that she carried out those difficult discussions with a measure of grace.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>High-profile female writers and speakers in American evangelicalism have traditionally focused on spiritual questions, and shied away from controversy and confrontation. But Evans often used her platform to challenge male pastors and leaders. Over the years, she sparred about theology, culture, and politics with prominent Christian men including Russell Moore, John Piper, Rod Dreher, and Mark Driscoll. (Many of them have expressed their prayers for her in recent weeks, after Evans shared the news of her illness.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Progressive Baptist Pastor John Thornton Jr. puts it well <a href="https://johnthorntonjr.substack.com/">in his newsletter</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll also confess that at times I found her frustrating. Sometimes she seemed a bit naive, taking conservative evangelicals at their word. I wanted her to just tell them to screw off. But I have to admit I found her interactions with many of them impressive. It always seemed rooted in a hope that they could and should be better and that in some way it was her job to stand for anyone that would listen. She offered thousands of people a glimpse of the ways the Christian faith could be less unkind and unfair than the conservative, white evangelicalism that Gen X and millennials were raised in. She seemed genuinely invested in the struggle for a better church when she had plenty of reason to walk away. She showed up and did the work because she knew people, especially people that churches had hurt over and over, needed her to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though I only occasionally read Evans’ writing, I remember the experience of feeling that she put ideas, that I couldn’t quite express, very succinctly. I was particularly struck by this Twitter thread.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And, in my experience, Mainline Protestants tend to put a heavy emphasis on the teachings of Jesus, with less emphasis on Paul/the epistles, while evangelicals tend to do the opposite. (Generalization alert! Sorry!)....</p>&mdash; Rachel Held Evans (1981-2019) (@rachelheldevans) <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelheldevans/status/943874497467297793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Mainline Christians often take a beating by evangelicals on the subject of biblical fidelity, but Evans’ words reminded me that it’s often just a matter of what parts of the Bible on which a church choses to focus. There are those in more conservative Christian circles who believe that mainline churches are losing members due to a lack of adherence to scripture. Joshua Tait, <a href="https://arcdigital.media/is-pete-buttigieg-a-christian-6e2ace0a208b">in this piece on Pete Buttigieg</a>, refers to this position as “demographic triumphalism.”</p>
<p>In truth, churches in mainline Christian denominations aren’t any less faithful to scripture, but their traditions have been built upon a different emphasis. They don’t tend to read the Bible as a constitution, where the “house rules” of Paul have the same importance as the gospel of Jesus. I was grateful to Evans’ for pointing this out, with numerous supporting examples. It’s just an example of how she could question certain dogma with clarity but also grace.</p>
<p>A great number of people are going to miss Rachel Held Evans for all sorts of reasons. Her voice was a critical one within the sphere of Christian thought. She kept many who would have otherwise left within the faith. We will be praying for her young family and many friends as they navigate through their grief.</p>

			 <p>I never was one to buy a ton of records, but one of the reasons I have slacked off of my vinyl purchasing lately is that not everything I have been excited about has been released on that format. That may be a problem with a resolution, thanks to <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2019/04/17/create-vinyl-with-bandcamp/">Bandcamp&rsquo;s new vinyl service</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, we’re offering a first glimpse of an initiative from Bandcamp that aims to address these challenges. Our new vinyl pressing service streamlines the financing, production, and fulfillment of vinyl records. With no up-front investment, an artist or label can create a vinyl campaign and start taking orders almost immediately. Once they reach their minimum goal, we press their records and ship them to their fans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For bands that can&rsquo;t take the risk of pressing records without knowing the level of interest, this provides them a safe way to test the waters and give the fans what they want.</p>
<p>This is another reason I consider Bandcamp to be a tremendously valuable service and an innovator in a time of a lot of upheaval in the music industry.</p>
<p>(Of course, <a href="https://toothandnailrecords.merchnow.com/products/v2/289803/young-in-my-head-old-blood-lp--dd">sold out prereleases</a> are a completely separate problem.)</p>

<p><em>This is a piece I wrote almost exactly a year ago. It never made it to this blog but it seems relevant as Christians head into Easter and celebrate the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve written favorably of The Faith Angle podcast before, and I continue to be impressed by the content on the show. In <a href="https://overcast.fm/+L73HeoDw8">the fifth episode</a>, guests Ross Douthat and Father James Martin argue the importance of adhering to traditional Catholic doctrine and when it’s imperative to set aside that doctrine in light of individual conscience and grace. Both are grounded in a strong theological tradition and both make strong points to support their views.</p>
<p>The primary doctrinal point of discussion is the indissolubility of marriage, which comes straight from Jesus’ teaching in the gospels. The question of application of the teaching comes into play when people are caught in a situation that finds them outside of the bounds of what is deemed acceptable by the church, sometimes through no fault or choice of their own. Co-host Kirsten Powers brings up the example of a friend whose husband cheated on her. After attempts to reconcile, the husband ended up leaving her friend for the other woman. Now outside of the Catholic Church’s rigid rules against divorce, the woman cannot receive the Eucharist.</p>
<p>Douthat, as the representative on the show for the more conservative viewpoint, sticks to the letter of the law in insisting that the woman should not receive the Eucharist because of the situation in which she has found herself. When listening to this judgement, it is important to remember that the Eucharist is one of the sacraments in both Catholic and Protestant churches. A sacrament is an avenue to God’s grace.  So, in Catholic teaching, a woman who has been abandoned by her husband is also cut off from a way to receive the grace of God. I certainly support Powers point that such rigidity without consideration of circumstances seems unfair. I would go beyond that, though, in that I believe the practice seems spiritually destructive.</p>
<p>In his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Kind-Christianity-Questions-Transforming/dp/0061853992/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1524426501&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+new+kind+of+christianity+by+brian+mclaren">A New Kind of Christianity</a>, author and pastor Brian McClaren tells the story of an Kenyan man who wept after participating in a worship service to which McClaren had invited him. When he asked the man why he was crying, the man assured him that the tears were caused by joy. The man was so happy because he had never before taken part in the Eucharist. In Kenya, the Anglican Church to which he belonged had made a policy for polygamous converts that only children of the first wife could participate in the Holy Supper. This man was the child of a third wife and therefore had never been able to take the sacrament.</p>
<p>We must be very careful in the exclusion of anyone from the table that Jesus sets for them. There are many instances portrayed in the gospels in which Jesus eats with or heals those that the religious authorities deem unworthy. In those cases, Jesus rebukes those who want to cling to rules over grace and inclusion. I believe we need to be especially discerning when we forbid people from participating in an avenue to God’s grace for reasons over which they have no control. These individuals have not flouted the commandments or even given up on their faith. People were not born into, nor can they be forced into, a situation that keeps them from being close to God through His son.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. <em>(Romans 8: 38-39)</em></p>

			 <p>For those who are creating on the web and even monetizing their creative output, Richard MacManus - <a href="https://micro.blog/ricmac">@ricmac</a> - has had some appealing content recently.
His <a href="https://creatorinterviews.com/2019/03/05/jason-kottke-og-blogger/">interview with Jason Kottke</a> dives into the journey Kottke has gone through in his 20+ years of blogging. I probably don&rsquo;t need to do too much to recommend Kottke&rsquo;s blog, as it already seems to have such a broad following. I will say I&rsquo;ve been reading the blog for years and he consistently has a variety of interesting posts. The posts on the popular blogger&rsquo;s site range from topics like <a href="https://kottke.org/19/03/a-map-of-fairyland-c-1920">maps of fairyland</a> to the <a href="https://kottke.org/19/02/the-life-changing-magic-of-the-15-minimum-wage">life changing magic of the $15 minimum wage</a>.
The interview with MacManus touches on where blogging stands in the current landscape of the web and gives insight into Kottke&rsquo;s view of things as a veteran of the medium. I have to admit, though, I never pictured Kottke looking the way he does in the picture that accompanies the interview.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://creatorinterviews.com/2019/03/19/cherie-hu-the-new-wave-of-new-media/">fascinating interview is with Cherie Hu</a>, who runs the newsletter Water + Music. I&rsquo;ve been reading Water + Music for the past year and have been impressed by the level of professionalism and angle of the content. The newsletter reads like a trade magazine about music and new media. Hu is definitely someone to watch and MacManus lets the interview run a bit longer than usual to get a fuller scope of her thoughts.</p>

			 <p>My little guy had his seventh name day not long ago. He was over the moon to receive what he called, &ldquo;birthday love&rdquo; from all the kids in Sunday School, grinning from ear to ear when they sang to him. We don&rsquo;t do big birthday parties for our boys, so he doesn&rsquo;t usually have a bunch of kids singing to him. We worried that he would be embarrassed, but that wasn&rsquo;t at all the case. The birthday love led him to search for &ldquo;birthday songs&rdquo; on my Apple Music account. These are the results that came up. All explicit.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2019/19977793cf.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It reminds me of the scene near the end of <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>, where protagonist Holden Caulfield discovers vulgar graffiti in a museum and gets all bummed out about how it will affect the little kids who see it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;d written &ldquo;F**k you&rdquo; on the wall. It drove me damn near crazy. I thought about how Phoebe and all the other little kids would see it, and how they&rsquo;d wonder what the hell it meant, and then finally some dirty kid would tell them - all cockeyed, naturally - what it meant, and how they&rsquo;d all <em>think</em> about it and maybe even <em>worry</em> about it for a couple of days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on, when he sees another instance of the same graffiti.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole trouble. You can&rsquo;t ever find a place that&rsquo;s nice and peaceful, because there isn&rsquo;t any. You may <em>think</em> there is, but once you get there, when you&rsquo;re not looking, someone will sneak up and write &ldquo;F**k you&rdquo; right under your nose.</p>

			 <p>Last year, for the first time, I fasted during Lent. I made Friday my fast day and fasted from sunup to sundown. It was an interesting experiment. Some days it wasn&rsquo;t too hard, other days the hunger was intense, or I would get a bad headache by the end of the day. The point of fasting (especially as part of Lenten devotion) isn&rsquo;t for it to be easy, though.</p>
<p>This past month, I spent 3 weeks sick with the flu and then bronchitis. During that time, I had little energy for anything and an appetite to match. Every day was difficult and it was even hard to sleep thinking about the things I had to do with such little resources. As I thought about fasting for Lent this year, I felt like I had already been through a fast-like experience. I wasn&rsquo;t sure it would be good for my body as I healed to put it through the physical fast, so I decided against following the routine I began last year.</p>
<p>As I was searching for alternatives to the Friday fast, my wife passed along <a href="http://www.holycrossblessedsacrament.org/the-bulletin/543-pope-francis-words-do-you-want-to-fast-this-lent">this list from Pope Francis</a> to which our Associate Pastor had posted a link on Facebook. I&rsquo;m trying to keep these guidelines in mind as I go through the season of Lent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast from hurting words and say kind words.</li>
<li>Fast from sadness and be filled with gratitude.</li>
<li>Fast from anger and be filled with patience.</li>
<li>Fast from pessimism and be filled with hope.</li>
<li>Fast from worries and trust in God.</li>
<li>Fast from complaints and contemplate simplicity.</li>
<li>Fast from pressures and be prayerful.</li>
<li>Fast from bitterness and fill your heart with joy.</li>
<li>Fast from selfishness and be compassionate to others.</li>
<li>Fast from grudges and be reconciled.</li>
<li>Fast from words and be silent so you can listen.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few of these, such as &ldquo;fast from pressures and be prayerful&rdquo; and &ldquo;fast from worries and trust in God,&rdquo; are especially meaningful to me this season. I hope I am able to keep them in my heart and mind and continue to cultivate habits that make them part of my life.</p>

			 <p>Most of the Record Store Day exclusives recently have not been my cup of tea. However, this year, <a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/02/record-store-day-2019-releases/">one release in particular</a> caught my eye after the tragic death of Richard Swift.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Death Cab For Cutie’s Ben Gibbard will pay tribute to friend and collaborator Richard Swift with a new 7-inch split single featuring two unreleased tracks recorded by the pair. The A-side is an unreleased demo of “Me and Magdalena” which Gibbard wrote for The Monkees’ 2016 album Good Times!. The B-side is an alternate unreleased version of Teenage Fanclub’s “The Concept” from Gibbard’s cover of the band’s Bandwagonesque album, which he released in 2017. Limited to 1,600 copies, with proceeds benefiting MusiCares.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can vouch for the quality of the album version of Gibbard&rsquo;s cover of &ldquo;The Concept&rdquo; from his full-length take on Teenage Fanclub&rsquo;s <em>Bandwagonesque</em>. It will be interesting to listen to the alternate version. Many times, with Swift&rsquo;s production, you can hear his style in the recording. I think I get just as much of Swift as I do Jurado on Damien Jurado&rsquo;s &ldquo;A.M. AM.&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>🎵 Writing for Bandcamp Daily, <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2019/02/22/bandcamp-essential-releases-february-22-2019/">Jes Skolnik describes the music of Barcelona&rsquo;s Fatamorgana</a> by relating the genre&rsquo;s of punk and techno. The minimal synth music created by a band whose members come from punk backgrounds certainly invites thought about the spare economics that can be a major component of both genres.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My friend Chris Berry’s joke about “the punk-to-techno pipeline” is something I think about a lot, as someone who used to hide in a bathroom in between the hardcore matinee show and the rave night that happened in the same space because they were underage and wanted to go to both. While they might seem like polar opposites instrumentally, they share a lot of musical history and a lot of commonality —there’s something both primal and communal about both styles, the core rhythm often being less essential than the surrounding filigree, and it’s possible to do a lot with a few resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The simplicity of the songs on Fatamorgana&rsquo;s <em>Terra Alta</em> lends the record a sort of hypnotic quality.  The music invokes EDM progenitors Kraftwerk while also calling to mind the feminine iciness of Ladytron.</p>

<p><img src="http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2019/2390c002d0.jpg" alt="Micro.blog vs. Tumblr"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A lot of people these days are worried about the demise of Tumblr. The product has changed hands a few times, and neither its Yahoo! parents or its Verizon parents seem to have paid much attention to it. M.G. Siegler <a href="https://500ish.com/tumblr-too-929b7d359221">took his concerns to his Medium blog</a>, 500ish Words. In the post, he evaluates the current alternatives to Tumblr. What is most interesting, to me, is his quick dismissal of Micro.blog, the platform that hosts this blog. He writes, “And other things such as the newer  <a href="https://micro.blog/?utm_campaign=First%20Draught&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Micro.blog</a> are almost too spartan.”</p>
<p>Micro.blog started out fairly limited, but has steadily built on a solid foundation. Truthfully, that’s the way most software developers believe products should iterate. The rate of iteration for Micro.blog has been fairly aggressive lately. So while I might have agreed with Siegler a little more than a week ago, when his post was written, I no longer do. In the past week, <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/01/30/custom-templates-categories.html">Micro.blog rolled out major improvements</a> that put it on par with Tumblr for personal blog hosting.</p>
<p>The most important of the new improvements was a most from being built on Jekyll to being built on Hugo, and with that, the inclusion of the ability to customize the design of your blog. This in itself is a huge step for Micro.blog, which previously allowed very limited customization options such as simple CSS overrides and footer design. Now blog owners are free to customize their entire themes, as well as share those customized themes with others on GitHub.</p>
<p>One ancillary benefit to the switch to Hugo, though, which I haven’t seen anyone on M.b. mention yet, is the ability to use Hugo shortcodes. Shortcodes elegantly allow for embedded content, the thing for which Tumblr is perhaps best known. They do so in a minimal way that fits in nicely with the markdown language that powers posts on Micro.blog. Previously, you could use embedded content on Micro.blog but it was not guaranteed to be responsive (a limitation of the Jekyll backend). Sure, you could embed a YouTube video, but switch to a mobile device and that thing would go right off the page. To properly handle embeds such as YouTube videos in Jekyll, you would have to install a plugin, something that wasn’t supported by Micro.blog. Even on Jekyll’s preferred hosting site, GitHub Pages, you would have to use <a href="https://github.com/nathancy/jekyll-embed-video">a solution like this</a>. In other words, such a common blogging use case as YouTube embeds was pretty challenging on the Jekyll platform. Now, many popular embeds (YouTube, Vimeo, Twitter and Instagram) are supported in Micro.blog by using Hugo shortcodes.</p>
<p>This may sound surprising, but In some ways, the new Micro.blog platform is actually <em>superior</em> to Tumblr when it comes to embeds. I say this as a formerly frustrated Tumblr user. I wanted to use a professionally designed Tumblr theme, but what I discovered was that embeds would behave differently on the front end of my blog than they would in the Tumblr dashboard. Some sites, such as Bandcamp, offer Tumblr-specific embedding options. Those options make the content appear correctly if you are a Tumblr user viewing it in the dashboard or if the blog is using the default theme. If you are using another theme, all bets are off for the majority of your viewers who are seeing the content in the front end of your blog. However, if you use standard embed codes, the content will probably look right on the front end of your custom theme, but it usually wouldn’t appear correctly in the Tumblr dashboard. This inconsistency caused me much consternation when I was an active Tumblr user. With a more standard set of embedding capabilities, Hugo and now Micro.blog provide a more consistent visual experience.</p>
<p>In his piece, Siegler also speculates on what a more contemporary Tumblr would look like.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s hard to know what a more modern Tumblr would look like — it would undoubtedly be mobile-first, but would it be better as a paid product these days? One major issue Tumblr had was a complete and utter failure to monetize. Ads seemed like a straightforward proposition, perhaps in a way similar to how they work on Instagram now. But for whatever reason, they never truly worked on Tumblr.</p>
<p>Could it be a right place/right time thing for a paid social network, truly free from advertising?  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facts-about-facebook-11548374613">There are certainly signs</a> . Such a product would never get to Facebook-scale, of course. But it wouldn’t have to. And actually, shouldn’t aspire to. That never seemed to be the success state for Tumblr anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Micro.blog is also close to what Siegler proposes as a “paid social network, truly free from advertising.” The social component that glues blogs together is actually free, but participated in most fully by using a Micro.blog paid, hosted account. Like the paid version of Tumblr that Siegler imagines, it will never get to Facebook scale, but it doesn’t need to in order to be compelling. The people who are using the platform are there because they are invested in it. The deliberate nature of the participation elevates the level of discourse in a way that isn’t, in my experience, matched on Tumblr. Not to mention that on Micro.blog, you don’t have to see repeated ads for situational teen sex games. Most months, that alone seems worth a few bucks.</p>

			 <p><strong>After pining for the Apple HomePod last year, but feeling like it was just a bit too expensive to justify purchasing at the time, I rejoiced when Apple announced they were bringing their music service to the Amazon Echo.</strong> I even wrote <a href="https://frostedechoes.com/2018/12/28/alexa-speaks-apple.html">a blog post</a> about the move.</p>
<p>My enthusiasm may have been a bit premature. I purchased one of the new Echo Plus units, with an Amazon gift card I had received, shortly after Christmas. After initially setting up the Apple Music skill, the smart speaker was pumping music for about a week when it just lost the ability one night. It wouldn’t play music from Apple or even Amazon, instead repeating the name of the track you had requested, pausing just a bit and then saying, “sorry, I’m having trouble playing the music.” Since the main reason I bought the device was to play music, this was a problem. In fact, I’d classify it as a severity 1 defect. I may use the home automation features of the Echo, at some point, but I can always turn a light on with my hands. I can make my own music as well, but you wouldn’t want to know how that usually turns out.</p>
<p>After the problem persisted, and after my attempts to reinstall the skill and reset the WiFi yielded no improvement, I took to the web for some research. I found someone on Twitter who originally essentially had the same issue and was now dealing with a much more compliant and capable Alexa. I asked him what he did to fix the problem. This was his response.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not a damn thing. It’s a very weird and idiosyncratic platform.</p>&mdash; Tom 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇦 Moore (@thmoore) <a href="https://twitter.com/thmoore/status/1083954581586042880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Well, needless to say, that didn’t change much, other than further deteriorating my faith in the device. I found some similar posts on the Amazon Echo forums and calling tech support didn’t seem to help anyone. After beating my head against the wall for almost a week and contemplating returning the device, Alexa suddenly became willing to play music again. This willingness lasted for a couple of weeks, then one fine day, Alexa again refused to discharge her duty. Thankfully, the next day, Alexa was back to her normal self again.</p>
<p>At this point, I’m pretty surprised that I’m not hearing more chatter about the inconsistency of Amazon’s platform. I’ve heard a lot about the potential privacy implications of a speaker that is always listening. However, I became a lot less concerned about that when I discovered the device had a microphone mute button placed prominently on top (although I still trust Apple much more than Amazon in the issue of privacy). The bigger concern for me is that I would consider Alexa to be flaky, at best, and that flakiness seems like it should be getting more attention.</p>

<p>🎵 <a href="https://youtu.be/u0WT5BQuYUs">Wild Nothing - Partners in Motion (live)</a>: There aren&rsquo;t a lot of dream pop bands that feature saxophone as prominently as Wild Nothing does in this song. The sax is allowed to take up even more space on the live version. The unusual instrumental arrangement with some interesting time signatures makes the song sound a bit like a cross between prog rock and sophistipop. The track is great on the record and takes on new life in this version. In other news, Wild Nothing just released an incredible <a href="https://wildnothing.lnk.to/BlueWings">new song called &ldquo;Blue Wings&rdquo;</a> last week. I spent Friday night listening to it over and over again. The elements, both musical and thematic, resonate strongly with me right now.</p>

			 <p>📚 <strong>The Idiot - Fyodor Dostoyevsky</strong>: I picked up this book many years ago and didn&rsquo;t get very far. I recently decided to give it another go, wanting to examine the ways in which the protagonist Prince was imagined to be a Christ-like figure, working his way through 19th century Russia. Unfortunately, it feels like the only parallel between the Prince and Christ is that the Prince seems to be a really nice guy. The connection is very one-dimensional and I&rsquo;m certainly disappointed in such a flat representation of the figure of Jesus. Reading this book makes me even more glad that Kingdom of Copper, the sequel to City of Brass, by S.A. Chakraborty, is coming out this week. I need to move on to something more interesting.</p>

			 <p>🔗 <a href="https://www.christiantoday.com/article/the.wisdom.of.deo.volente/29181.htm">The wisdom of Deo Volente</a></p>
<p>Just as Muslims say &ldquo;inshallah,&rdquo; after mentioning plans to do something, so also can the Christian keep God&rsquo;s providence in mind when discussing what the future may bring.</p>
<p>This hit home for me recently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>James 4:13 instructs those who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money” with the reminder, “You do not even know what will happen tomorrow…Instead you ought to say, ‘If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that’”. It’s not that the Bible condemns forward planning, but it’s simply that we should never leave God out of our future plans. In the old days people used to add the letters D.V. to all such intentions, an abbreviation for a short Latin phrase, Deo Volente, which means ‘God willing’.</p>

			 <p>I like the idea of <a href="https://elezea.com/2018/12/analog-over-digital/">an analog manifesto</a> from <a href="https://micro.blog/rianvdm">@rianvdm</a>. The comparison to the Agile Manifesto, with it’s message of preference, not exclusion, seems appropriate. This coming year I’m going to try to manage my home tasks and journaling with a bullet journal and my work tasks with Things. I’ve discovered over this past year that what works in one environment is not always as effective in another.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure about New Year’s Resolutions, but if I have any, it would be to look at everything through the lens of a new manifesto: analog over digital. Just as with the Agile Manifesto, the word “over” is of utmost importance here. It doesn’t mean I’m done with digital. It just means that I want to look at the things I do, and critically evaluate whether or not an analog approach could be more meaningful. For example, should I stop tracking my runs on Strava, and just enjoy them instead? Should I have a go at hand journaling instead of putting everything in Day One? The answer may very well be “no”, but I’d like to ask the question more in 2019.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know I’m mostly waiting in vain, though, because I know those days have passed. In previous years the Christmas Eve discussion was, “How early can we get up?” This year it was, “How late can we sleep in?” It’s a funny thing to see your children grow up and to remember the way things used to be. It’s a funny thing to have to begin to create a new normal, to make old, comfortable traditions fit a new, less-comfortable context. I liked the way things were. But I think I like the way things are, as well. At least, I can come to like it.</p>

			 <p>Though I have yet to see any of the ad placements he writes about, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-heavily-promotes-the-amazon-echos-apple-music-integration/">this piece from John Voorhees</a> in MacStories about Apple heavily promoting the Apple Music/Amazon Echo integration comes as little surprise. Voorhees believes that the motivation for Apple to strike this partnership with their sometimes rival in services may be to get their hardware back on Amazon&rsquo;s virtual shelves. While I haven&rsquo;t read any contradicting information about the deal, I believe there may be another reason entirely.</p>
<p>Ever since the arrival of the HomePod at the $350 price point, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/18/homepod-only-6-percent-markethsare-customers-prefer-cheaper-alts/">there has been speculation</a> that Apple will eventually come out with a lower cost model to compete with Amazon and Google&rsquo;s offerings. There seems to be consensus that Apple must achieve a lower price point to stand a chance of taking market share from their more entrenched rivals. M.G. Siegler even <a href="https://500ish.com/alexa-everywhere-eeee670a5f02">wondered if Apple might not be trying to compete with Amazon at all</a> with their HomePod. I&rsquo;m no tech pundit, but looking at the history of Apple reveals they don&rsquo;t always offer a lower-cost alternative to compete in a given market. Despite all of the breathless commentary that they simply <em>had</em> to come out with a netbook, they never did. The Mac Mini was designed to be a low cost entry to the Mac world and even that is now more high-end that it&rsquo;s humble beginnings ever suggested it would be. iPhone models keep getting more expensive. Look across Apple&rsquo;s hardware line and you will find less entry-level options than perhaps they&rsquo;ve ever had in the recent past.</p>
<p>Apple typically makes profits on margins from more expensive hardware. Amazon sells inexpensive hardware to move services and digital goods (look at the Kindle model). However, Apple Music is trying to be a Spotify competitor. They can&rsquo;t do that with only a $350 smart speaker and a Sonos integration. They will lose. The barrier to entry for filling a room with music from Apple&rsquo;s streaming service is too high. So do they dumb down their smart speaker? Why do that and lose the margins and the cultural cachet of having the <em>best</em> sounding smart speakers on the market? They can much more easily tap into the huge user base that Amazon has without having to adjust their hardware strategy.</p>

The only problem with these shorts is, well, they&rsquo;re <em>too</em> short. My six-year-old is just getting into an episode when it abruptly ends.

			 <p>Each year at Thanksgiving time, I think about the time I spent working in retail and the family time that had to be given up during the holiday season at the end of the year. I used to have to get up at 3am the morning after Thanksgiving to go to work and prep for the Black Friday stampede. In those early morning hours, I would arrive at work to find a line had already formed to await the opening of the doors. I would setup as the customers outside braved the cold and sipped on hot chocolate and coffee by the side of the building.</p>
<p>During the busy shopping season, we had team meetings where it was acknowledged that working extra hours during the holidays was hard, but it was explained that was what you had to do in order to work in retail. The way it was said made it sound like we were all pursuing our dream of working in the retail space. It was as if extended holiday hours were just the sacrifice we had to make in order to live out those dreams. It probably goes without saying, but for many of us, working in retail was not the ultimate fulfillment of our occupational fantasies.</p>
<p>Last week, the incomparable Liz Bruenig <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/thanksgiving-is-a-day-to-stop-leaning-in--and-lean-back-instead/2018/11/21/117f731e-edb0-11e8-8679-934a2b33be52_story.html">had a post</a> on Thanksgiving being the only vestige of the medieval tradition of feasts that used to be a major part of people’s lives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanksgiving may be the only bona fide American feast day. Every other holiday has some other activity or occasion to recommend it, but Thanksgiving is a feast to celebrate feasting and to express gratitude for everything that can’t be properly commodified: family, friendship, the autumn season. The meaning of it may be less distinct than your average medieval feast, but the sense that it’s about something better and truer than the ordinary grind of work is what lends it its emotional depth (and what makes the travesty of workers forced to labor on the holiday so despicable ).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I see that more and more stores are opting to open on Thanksgiving, I feel really badly for the employees who have to staff those stores when they should be spending time with their friends and family. As change in our society continues to accelerate, Thanksgiving remains an anomaly in prescribing time for nurturing connections. We have to hold on to those meaningful traditions that we have in the face of consumerist encroachment. At the very least, we should avoid patronizing those stores that care so little for the family lives of their employees (certainly on Thanksgiving).</p>

			 <p>Nearby here, Samuel Oliver-Bruno, an undocumented immigrant living in a sanctuary church for the last year, was lured out by USCIS yesterday, under the pretense that they needed to get his fingerprints for his petition to stay. Upon appearing for his appointment, <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article222024860.html">he was arrested by plain clothes ICE officers</a> in an apparent entrapment. Reps. David Price and GK Butterfield have previously called for deferred action in Oliver-Bruno’s case as his wife has lupus, among other health conditions, and he is the sole breadwinner for their household. Oliver-Bruno was accompanied to the appt. by local pastors. 26 protesters were arrested by local police at the scene of the detainment.</p>
<p>Although this man is living in the country illegally, such crimes are subject to discretion in their prosecution and this case certainly seems to be one that requires a measure of clemency. It is unfortunate that government resources are being used to target individuals like this.</p>

<p>The public was recently treated <a href="https://youtu.be/ryorxnoVWxQ">to a preview</a> of the new Star Wars themed areas at Disneyland/Disney World that was accompanied, most appropriately, by a John Williams soundtrack. The new parks, called “Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge,” look as amazing as their $24 billion dollar price tags suggest they would. With openings in summer and fall of next year, respectively, the days of counting down will soon be starting for fans.</p>
<p>Watching this video reminded me of why Disney World is one of my two favorite places to visit. Everything is so meticulously crafted, down to the smallest details, for the enjoyment of the guest. So much care is taken to transport everyone who enters the parks into fantasy worlds so tightly woven together that the real world barely even creeps in at the seams. The new Star Wars parks are reportedly going to have Star Wars themed food, allowing visitors to immerse even their taste buds in culinary delights from a galaxy far, far away. The fabricated landscapes will be a reminder of the terrains from Star Wars films. As with all of the Disney parks, power cables are sure to be carefully tucked away, entrances and exits of cast members portraying galactic heroes and villains cleverly hidden from view. Cards can be loaded up with the lingua franca of digital park currency so money need not be thought of while inside the premises. Obfuscating mammon is just another way of abstracting park life from the real world.</p>
<p><img src="https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2018/51be6b76a6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>By contrast my other favorite place to visit is in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, almost the opposite of the carefully man-made artifice of the Disney parks. I love staying in the high desert, but the National Park at Mesa Verde, where people long ago built cities into the rock of the cliffs is another favorite spot. In Colorado, nature barely seems to have succumbed to any attempts to tame it.  The wild creeps in almost everywhere in this part of the country. Ghost towns that didn’t survive the sometimes harsh climate are accessed via uneven gravel roads that take skill to drive on and punish your car for the effort. Mountains tower almost everywhere you look, practically daring you to try and scale their lofty heights. Signs along the road remind you boulders might fall on you at any time, bursting the illusion that your car can protect you from the crumbling landscape.</p>
<p>Summer in the high desert offers warm temps during the day and a cool break from the heat at night. Here in North Carolina, during the summer, there is no respite from the punishing heat and humidity. Even the nights are oppressively muggy. In the Rockies, when the dry air of the desert gets to you, the humidity of the ice grottos are not far away. If you don’t like your climate, get in your car and drive an hour or two (at least in the summer). Places to stop your car and just admire the beauty of the landscape are setup all over the Colorado roads. I’ve even seen someone stop, break out a chair, and start reading a book.</p>
<p>In many ways, these places couldn’t be more different, but each offers something at its best. Seeing God’s unaltered creation in the magnificence of the mountains or enjoying what man can create with skill and ingenuity both offer enormous appeal to this traveler.</p>

			 <p>Justin Kossyln, who works in product management for Alphabet, argues it may be time to <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/3k9q33/the-internet-needs-more-friction">add some friction</a> back to the web.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the internet’s lack of friction has been a boon to the dark side, too. Now, in a matter of hours a “bad actor” can steal corporate secrets or use ransomware to blackmail thousands of people. Governments can influence foreign populations remotely and at relatively low cost. Whether the threat is malware, phishing, or disinformation, they all exploit high-velocity networks of computers and people.</p>
<p>It’s time to bring friction back. Friction buys time, and time reduces systemic risk. A disease cannot become an epidemic if patients are cured more quickly than the illness spreads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>​While I totally agree with Kosslyn that adding a little bit of difficulty to the process of posting and spreading content online could be a good thing, doing so would be harder than it sounds. For instance, he suggests forcing social apps to be locally oriented, rather than global by default. I&rsquo;m afraid it would be very difficult to put that genie back in the bottle. Too many people have wished to have their non-directional self-disclosures broadcast to the entire planet to turn back now. It would most likely take government intervention which would probably then raise cries of censorship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that most of the general public has grasped the concept that just because we can have a technology doesn&rsquo;t mean we should. Not yet, at least. It would most likely take violence in the Western world, the kind of which has been aided by Facebook in Myanmar and India, to wake people up. Let&rsquo;s hope and pray that kind of violence stops rather than spreading.</p>

The game is strange enough to keep you intrigued throughout. The soundtrack, which only reveals itself in certain parts, reminds me a little bit of something <a href="http://shop.hammockmusic.com/track/dark-beyond-the-blue">like this</a>, from the band Hammock. My 6-yr. old and I sort of tag-teamed Inside, which made for a fantastic bonding experience. If you pick one game to buy for the Apple TV (or any other platform), Inside would be a great choice.</p>

			 <p>I will be playing more of the <em>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</em> D&amp;D campaign tonight. This module has a great level of detail and, once you get past the initial adventure, a lot of opportunity for individual choices and character growth. The city of Waterdeep is richly filled out, which makes it a great backdrop for inexperienced and experienced players and DM&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We have found D&amp;D to be a really fun Saturday night event for family and friends. It appears <a href="https://christandpopculture.com/dungeons-dragons-and-the-church/">that others</a> are feeling <a href="https://qz.com/emails/quartz-obsession/1466119/">the same way</a>.</p>

<p>I think the game is part of a movement away from the isolation of computers and mobile devices: People want to get together on Friday night or Saturday night with their friends around a table, and be social and play a social game, rather than staring at their phone and netting zero for the next five hours.

<p>Though he probably won&rsquo;t be thought of as the most dynamic speaker, Zhu&rsquo;s humility, work ethic, desire to give back and vulnerability give strength to his message.

<p>From Eghbal&rsquo;s <a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/public-faith">explanation about the origins of the show</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is faith so much more visible in open source, then? My theory: faith and open source both place high value on community and a sense of public service. Organized religion is the original distributed community, and it’s lasted thousands of years.</p>

			 <p><strong>The Apple New Music algorithm tries</strong>. It really does. At the end of every work week, it conjures up recommendations of recently released material that it thinks I would like. Sometimes, as was the case in early September, it finds a song from a band I&rsquo;ve never heard of, that instantly becomes <a href="http://frostedechoes.com/2018/10/05/softer-still-turtle.html">a new favorite of mine</a>.</p>
<p>Most Friday&rsquo;s, though, I end up skipping through a lot of tracks that feel like near misses. This Friday, the list didn&rsquo;t include the new single from Hammock, one of my all time most listened to bands, but instead served up an interview with the Pixies. That was slightly baffling. The mix is usually a bit off, though. Some weeks, I&rsquo;m given more sloppy, tossed off indie rock than is completely warranted. Others weeks, the mix is heavy on Eurotrash-inspired electronic. I do realize that coming up with brand new music that will fit my tastes every Friday is a tough job. Until I&rsquo;m willing to <a href="https://qz.com/quartzy/1399279/spotify-can-use-your-ancestry-dna-test-to-tell-your-musical-dna/">give up my DNA to get a better playlist</a> , which I don&rsquo;t see happening anytime soon, this is probably as good as it gets. So I listen patiently and hope for that one gem to really catch my ear.</p>
<p><strong>Music aside, Apple is putting me in a tough place this year.</strong> You see, I bought an iPad Pro earlier in the year. It was a good purchase, as it helped me to study for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam. However, if the rumors prove to be true, a new iPad Pro may be announced in a couple of weeks. It is <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-october-30th-event/">being speculated</a> that the new iPad would have an edge-to-edge screen and external display support. While the larger built-in screen size would be a nice to have, the support for an external display would be something of a game changer. This feature would put the dream of using an iPad as a main machine much closer. Now, if you could only do things like download songs from Bandcamp and add them to your music library from iOS&hellip;</p>

			 <p>At its most effective, group therapy is successful primarily because it destroys the fallacy that we are alone in our sufferings. To discover that another individual has the same feelings that you have but thought were unique to you can be a revelation. We tend to see the face that others put on in order to get through the day and forget that the person we are viewing has many of the same fears and frustrations that we have but are also hiding. We look at the frozen smiles in Instagram posts and believe the stories that they tell us, which may not look like our own.</p>
<p>Meditation can be difficult and sometimes it doesn’t feel as rewarding as we are led to believe. In his daily blog, Grind Well, Jon Mitchell takes his readers through a life informed by a meditation habit. Mitchell doesn’t shy away from the difficulty of the practice, or even of the skepticism that pops up about the importance of having a meditation habit. His posts make you feel like you are not the only one who struggles with meditation.</p>
<p>The subject of the daily (except on Shabbat, as Mitchell is an observant Jew) posts vary, but always center around the practice of meditation and mindfulness. In a post entitled <a href="https://grindwell.org/2018/08/16/mindfulness-politics.html">Mindfulness Politics</a>, Mitchell writes about politics from a perspective colored by the calm and detachment that can come with regular meditation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is what’s frustrating about this era’s political, religious, and otherwise tribal upheavals. There is some threshold of scale at which human beings — from their default perspectives enmeshed in worldly concerns — will consider a problem important enough to fight about, and that scale is not <em>nearly</em> big enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His point in the post is that a meditation habit can be part of taking care of ourselves in a way that helps to alleviate suffering, increases compassion for others and put distance between our impulses to anger and our sense of positive awareness. These are certainly things the world needs more of right now and an honest look at how meditation can help is most welcome.</p>

			 <p>Alexis Madrigal writes about how, despite the ability to switch to the reverse-chronological timeline, <a href="https://medium.com/the-atlantic/you-can-never-go-back-to-the-old-twitter-afbaef33acfc">you can never go back to the old Twitter</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twitter always had a high-modernist novel’s scope — you peer into the boxes, and see someone having tea, a war you should have known was going on, a parent’s take on a 4-year-old, the latest ProPublica investigation, a screenshot of some idiot, a video of a black person being killed by police, an ad for Quiznos, and then Donald Trump tweeting about the television program he’s watching. The stack of information was contextless, traumatizing, and bizarre, but also energizing, the way a city makes you walk faster. It did that, but for your mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His comparison of the frenetic energy of Twitter to a bustling city makes me want to move out to the country. I&rsquo;ve become entirely too weary of the constant context-shifting that the timeline (whether chronological or not) forces you into. Since my tweets are almost entirely syndicated from my blog, I mainly engage with Twitter these days via the Notifications tab to see the top tweets from my feed and responses to my tweets.</p>

The process of virtual collaboration gives the EP&rsquo;s a certain breezy detachment that has its own charm.</p>

			 <p>My family just enjoyed a beach trip with many of the amenities that renting a house by the ocean provides. In addition to all of the beach-related luxuries, we had cable television, which has long been absent from our house. It was a bit of a culture shock, going from the work of antenna-sourced television to the cesspool of cable TV, though. It was somewhat like imagining what it would look like if the unfortunate and immoral residents of Sodom and Gomorrah had closed-circuit television broadcasts. Or, maybe to be more charitable, it was like a teenager crafted the programming schedule and advertising sales for a network.</p>
<p>As my six-year-old and twelve-year-old watched, I heard things in the background which I did not want to hear. I’m even excluding the Kavanaugh hearings (which were full of their own inappropriateness). Commercials for fighting matches and sex pills abounded. The lyrics to <a href="https://www.adweek.com/agencies/trojan-man-makes-a-riotous-return-as-your-guide-to-the-big-sexy-world/">one commercial</a> went “It’s a big sexy world of sex out there/People having intercourse everywhere.”</p>
<p>I mentioned recently that I’m glad that my youngest son basically only watches public television and this trip only reinforced that view. Not only is he not exposed to the constant commercialism that pervades a lot of children’s programming, but he doesn’t have to deal with exposure to the excessive evidence of adult vices.</p>

			 <p>The other day, on Twitter, I stumbled across <a href="https://twitter.com/boringstein/status/1034598016685158400?s=12">this thread</a> of people espousing their opinions about the Myers-Briggs personality profiler (or MBTI - Myer’s Briggs Type Indicator). Quite a few of the negative comments seem to be based on the belief that the origins of the type indicator are not scientifically credentialed enough. It is interesting to see a bunch of folks on Twitter who probably have no background in personality study attacking the MBTI for its humble origins in clinical observation done by CG Jung. Since I personally know multiple mental health professionals who swear by the MBTI, particularly in its application to relationship counseling, it strikes me as almost laughable to read these arm-chair tweets from people who consider themselves experts after say, reading <a href="%5Bwww.vox.com/2014/7/15...%5D(https://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5881947/myers-briggs-personality-test-meaningless#)#This+isn%E2%80%99t+a+test+designed+to+accurately+categorize+people%2C+but+a+test+designed+to+make+them+feel+happy+after+taking+it.+This+is+one+of+the+reasons+why+it%E2%80%99s+persisted+for+so+many+years+in+the+corporate+world%2C+despite+being+disregarded+by+psychologists.">a Vox article</a> on the subject. While the indicator may or may not be ideal for determining vocational direction, that is not its only application. It works well as a framework for navigating interpersonal dynamics.</p>
<p>I’m not even sure the origins of the framework matter that much. Ultimately, is the way the test was developed the measure of its usefulness in practice? Blood thinners started out as rat poison, but practicing physicians would endorse their use for preventing clots. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator">Validity and reliability may be considered low for Myers-Briggs</a> within the psychometric community, but material real-work outcomes are observable in a clinical environment. If the test was truly as useless as its critics claim, wouldn’t those using it in practice toss it aside?</p>

			 <p>It seems the latest distraction thrown at the American public, from the president, is attacking the top Internet companies (Google, Twitter and Facebook) in just another step in the strategy of “feed the press or it eats you.” After all, though, it’s only natural that the constant cries of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/10/24/the-ugly-history-of-luegenpresse-a-nazi-slur-shouted-at-a-trump-rally/">lugenpresse</a> would eventually extend to the internet giants.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Picciuto from Arc Digital <a href="https://arcdigital.media/the-right-discovers-affirmative-action-78bda38bd43f?source=rss----f9c5fcce5341---4">argues the benefit</a> for the president of consistently working to delegitimize any source of news that paints him in a bad light.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trump also has an interest in slamming Google, Facebook, and Twitter. He has had remarkable success convincing his supporters that negative news about Trump is not evidence of the fact that he has warranted such terrible coverage. Rather, negative stories are evidence that shadowy forces are arrayed against him, preventing him from maximizing the amazing competence he assures us he has. This belief has gained such traction on the right that government intervention is newly attractive. Even if no intervention materializes, Trump may end up cowing Google into bending its rules to appease a right-leaning mob, as  <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/08/08/636644539/jack-dorsey-explains-why-twitter-didnt-block-alex-jones-bucking-big-tech-trend">Twitter has done</a> .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an interesting (or frightening) twist, though, this particular cry of foul play has brought out a call among conservatives for more government regulation of media. In essence, the point those who are claiming victimization are making is that affirmative action is needed to combat systemic structural bias on the internet. Picciuto writes that this seems to be a major point of hypocrisy for some who have been decrying or even trying to dismantle affirmative action in education and corporate hiring practices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What the Trumpian right seems to be demanding is a full-bore state-managed affirmative action program for conservatives—all the while ridiculing and denying that the same should exist for marginalized groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether this is just the distraction du jour or a the start of a real push for some regulation of information to combat a perceived disadvantage on the internet remains to be seen.</p>

			 <p>The Reagan administration was known for its deregulation initiatives. I never thought about one of those initiatives that probably actually had the most impact on my life as a child during the Reagan years, though.</p>
<p>For decades, the FCC had rules that limited “excessive advertising.” This affected the amount of commercialism that could creep into children’s shows. Groups like Action for Children’s Television (ACT) ensured compliance with the rules.</p>
<p>Consequence of Sound <a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/mac-and-me-how-ronald-reagan-paved-the-way-for-one-of-the-worst-kids-movies-ever/">has a piece</a> that speaks to how things were different under Reagan and how that enabled film-length product placement opportunities like <em>Mac and Me</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then along came the Gipper, and everything changed. Ronald Reagan, infamous nemesis of corporate regulations, began gutting the FCC from the inside, starting with his appointment of Mark Fowler as FCC commissioner in 1981. Fowler was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/19/arts/under-fowler-fcc-treated-tv-as-commerce.html">fellow acolyte of Big Business</a>, a firm believer of the dominance of market forces as a yardstick for quality in broadcasting. Fowler summarily began cutting regulation after regulation for advertisement on children’s programming. In his mind, the free market would decide what programming was entertainment and what was just another ad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Partly as a consequence of the loosening of programming rules, though also partly as a result of the success of Star Wars and its accompanying merchandise, most kids cartoons I watched during my elementary school years were essentially toy advertisements.  G.I. Joe, Transformers, GoBots, M.A.S.K, Masters of the Universe, Thundercats, Silverhawks and probably a few others that I have forgotten were all shows that had their own lines of action toys. I was all-too-susceptible to what those shows were selling. I’m not sure it was really even necessary to have traditional adverts breaking up those shows as the shows themselves probably moved mountains of licensed products.</p>

			 <p>This week, for the first time in a long time, I actually enjoyed following the general news cycle in the US. I’m not going to lie, I have long harbored a belief that electing a white collar criminal to the office of President of the United States was a very bad idea. It’s more than mere gloating that gave me a sense of satisfaction from the events unfolding this week, though. There is perhaps of a ray of light at the end of this very dark tunnel. A feeling of, dare I say it, hope.</p>
<p>My dad once told me that the difference in Republicans and Democrats was that Democrats stuck by their people, no matter how many or grievous their misdeeds. He said Republicans, on the other hand, had a moral center that enabled them to cast out their own, if that person had done wrong. As evidence, he cited the Watergate scandal and how the Republicans had abandoned Nixon when it became clear he had broken the law.</p>
<p>In short, my dad was obviously very mistaken in his faith that a political party will always do the right thing. In the last few years, we have seen the Republican party excuse more inappropriate and criminal behavior than had been previously fathomable. This period certainly represents a new low in American history and will taint those groups who aided and abetted it for a long time. It’s perfectly reasonable to believe it could be generations before those parties involved can claim any sort of moral high ground.</p>
<p>It didn’t take someone with special powers of prognostication or foresight to predict these most recent events. As many, many people recognized, the legal woes that plague the president and his cabal are the most likely outcome of all that has transpired these past few tumultuous years. The quicker these matter are resolved, though, and this ugly and divisive chapter of US history is finished, the better it will be for our county.</p>

<p>🎵 <strong>Stars - Heart</strong>: There is an apocryphal story about a couple that wanted to play “their song,” Stars “Elevator Love Letter,” when they got married. They wanted to play it from a record, but unfortunately, the album was never available on vinyl. Not to be deterred by manufacturing logistics, the couple had a copy pressed onto a 7” single at Jack White’s Third Man Records in Nashville, TN, giving them the ability to play the record at their wedding.</p>
<p>The second Stars album is now out on vinyl, for the first time, 15 years after its original debut. Far from being stale or dated, it sounds <em>immediate</em>.</p>

			 <p>Augustine, some of his contemporaries, and theologians in the Medieval era reinterpreted Virgil&rsquo;s poem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclogue_4">Eclogue 4</a> to be a prediction of the birth of Jesus Christ. Many regarded Virgil as a pre-Christian prophet or a virtuous pagan. In keeping with this tradition, Dante included Virgil as his guide through the <em>Inferno</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under thy guidance, whatso tracks remain
Of our old wickedness, once done away,
Shall free the earth from never-ceasing fear.
He shall receive the life of gods, and see
Heroes with gods commingling, and himself
Be seen of them, and with his father&rsquo;s worth
Reign o&rsquo;er a world at peace.</p>

<p>I recently had my name day and added 2 years to the 4 decades I&rsquo;ve been on the earth. I observed my birthday by undertaking a pilgrimage to the closest mecca of low-cost contemporary home furnishings, to buy some shelves for my turntable and records. After spending more than 20 years collecting records, I still did not have an ideal storage solution for them. While I&rsquo;ve always rejected the argument that people collect vinyl for purely performative reasons, I&rsquo;ve seen through Instagram&rsquo;s discover algorithm that there are many people who do enjoy showing off their records. With very few exceptions, these people have much better storage solutions than apple crates sitting under a 25-year-old pinball machine (my old setup).</p>
<p>Once I had acquired and put together some new Kallax shelves and organized my audio equipment and media, my thoughts turned to whether I needed to get some new vinyl to break in the new setup. My brother and sister-in-law had generously gifted me with a Bandcamp gift card and I had a couple of choices for how to spend it. I could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy something digital that was not available on Apple Music (these finds are increasingly rare, but definitely still out there).</li>
<li>Buy a physical copy of something that I already have access to via streaming.</li>
</ul>
<p>With my new furniture in mind, I was leaning towards the latter option. Then, I ran into a problem that I&rsquo;m not used to dealing with: scarcity.</p>
<p>With everything available digitally and no limitations on the number of consumers, I&rsquo;ve gotten used to being able to acquire virtually any music I want. When I step back into the world of physical media, I have to deal with manufactured goods, supply chains and consumer buying projections.</p>
<p>A phrase that has been relegated to the back of my mind while living in this new age of digital abundance is “sold out.” As I looked back at some of the records I had my eye on at Bandcamp, I came across the phrase more than once, when trying to buy physical copies of <a href="https://ericstrip.bandcamp.com/album/love-tara">albums I had loved</a> during my high school days. I remembered well those days of making trips to the mall in the mostly vain hopes that the Sam Goody would have an album by that band that I’d heard the bass player from Dinosaur Jr. had started.</p>
<p>Many record companies release a limited number of records on colored vinyl to entice consumers to buy early. It’s a strategy that makes sense. Frequently, I’m tempted to wait to buy a copy of an album on vinyl until I’m sure it’s worth shelling out the American bucks. The “peak vinyl” program, as <a href="https://www.mergerecords.com/">Merge Records</a> calls it, turns that around and makes it more enticing to go ahead and buy the album, before it’s released, to get the cool color variants, before they are all gone. It’s a bummer when you don’t order an album early enough to get the “special” version, especially when it’s one of your favorite bands and you didn’t originally know they had something coming out. It’s something else entirely when you can’t get the album at all. That is accompanied by a feeling that to which I’ve grown unaccustomed.</p>

The following song on the album, &ldquo;Rainbow Skies,&rdquo; sounds like an outtake from <em>Odyssey and Oracle</em>, if the master tape had been sitting in someone&rsquo;s car on a Texas summer afternoon. The one after that, &ldquo;Oceans Alive,&rdquo; a nice slice of lo-fi baroque chamber-pop.

			 <p>📚 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Christian-World-Christ-Renaissance/dp/B001YVV3Z0">The Making of the Christian World - Robert Payne</a>:  I picked up this book from a retiring pastor who was paring down his library. From its title and cover, I expected a fairly academic treatment of historical matter. I was surprised by the content I found inside. Instead of a cold and dry recounting of events long past, I found poetry that was warm and inviting. Payne does an admirable job trying to find words to describe the unimaginable and transcendent. His prose brings back a world from which we are so far removed. A world where prophets sprang forth from the arid desert and the Messiah preached encouragement to the broken-hearted. A world teeming with encounters of the spiritual.</p>
<p>When discussing the apocryphal book, The Acts of John, Payne writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This account of the first meeting of James and John with Jesus has a hallucinatory quality, as of something seen and remembered with fearful clarity. Whoever wrote those mysterious lines was either a master storyteller, who knew exactly how to achieve his effects, or he was recording a living tradition, as it was once related by James of John. Origen, the most distinguished and influential of all of the Fathers of the ancient church, found no great difficulty in believing that Jesus changed his appearance according to the needs of the onlookers. There is a passage in the Talmud that describes Jesus as “cloudlike.” It is perhaps the best of all adjectives to describe him as he moves silently across the land, belonging more to the sunlit sky than to the earth, shining with a mysterious light. Cloud-like, he eludes us to the end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his description of Jerusalem, Payne focuses on an environment ripe for hearing messages that are not of human descent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if the stones of the Judaean wilderness break men’s hearts, the pure glinting skies bearing the sands of the Negev and of Arabia uplift their hearts. The sky over Jerusalem is a rich golden-blue, never at rest. It is the color of majesty, so ornate and shimmering that it seems artificial. There is a sense of splendor beyond human comprehension. On a summer’s day, God’s face shines visibly in the heavens. The air breathes and the light glancing off one mountain clashes visibly with the light glancing off another. In the trembling glory of that superb light all things seem possible; and in the presence of that light, one no longer wonders why the prophets entered the Judaean wilderness and came out again with revelations of God’s presence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Payne immerses you in the ancient world. I have only read through the sections about the Apostle Paul, but I am interested in the author’s treatment of later events in the Christian Church.</p>

			 <p>Last year, I taught a confirmation class of 8th graders about famous Presbyterians. Although few really knew who he was, my favorite among those discussed was Fred Rogers.</p>
<p>With the release of the movie <em>Won’t You Be My Neighbor</em>, Mr. Rogers has once again become a topic of conversation. <a href="https://micro.blog/vasta">@vasta</a> <a href="https://www.inthemargins.ca/mr-rogers-doc">recounts his emotional experience</a> of the film, which was colored by his lifelong admiration of the beloved children’s show host. One thing that stood out to him is that even Fred Rogers suffered from self-doubt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About halfway through  <a href="https://letterboxd.com/vasta/film/wont-you-be-my-neighbor/">Won’t You Be My Neighbor</a> , we discover a typewritten letter written by Fred Rogers that exposes his doubts, his uncertainty of whether he was up to the job. This was profound: I struggle with my doubts every day, as so many of us do, and always ask myself if I really can deliver on making the world better. I ask myself if my work matters, and even if it does, if it couldn’t be better done by someone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fred Rogers taught me that “you don’t have to be sensational for people to love you,” but it was poignant to know that even someone as sensational as him had to battle self-doubt throughout his life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christ and Pop Culture <a href="https://christandpopculture.com/its-a-beautiful-day-in-the-twitter-hood/">provides an examination</a> of how Mr. Rogers’ view of his role on television can inform our behavior on social media.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When  <a href="https://www.emmys.com/video/fred-rogers-hall-fame-induction-1999">accepting his induction</a>  in the Television Hall of Fame, Mr. Rogers said, “I feel that those of us in television are chosen to be servants. Doesn’t matter what our particular job, we are chosen to help the deeper needs of those who watch and listen, day and night.… We have only one life to live on earth, and through television we have the choice of encouraging others to demean this life, or to cherish it in creative and imaginative ways.” This seems to be a great mission statement for our social media use. Not everyone has to be on social media, but those who are (in whatever way we are) can think of ourselves as chosen to be servants, as having a choice in how to engage. There are many ways to interact on the internet: What if we chose to interact in a way that helps others cherish this life?</p>

<p>With polarization, insecurity and animosity running high, it seems like an especially fitting time to remember this man.</p>

			 <p>Philip Christman <a href="https://tinyletter.com/philipchristman/letters/the-tourist-volume-39">captures the kind of frustration</a> I felt when using Tinyletter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Readers, I apologize for the atrocious formatting of last week&rsquo;s newsletter. I have trouble making the UI of TinyLetter work on my laptop&ndash;in particular, it never wants to link. So sometimes I cut-and-paste the thing from elsewhere. That seems to have bitten us all in the ass. When I got my copy of my own newsletter, all the words were cut off on the right. It was mortifying, like the time I realized I had taught an entire class with my fly open. Since I am still unable to get the UI to work today, we may face the same issues all over again this week, but since I’m cutting-and-pasting from a different source, perhaps we will face new and exciting issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For such a simple service, there are a lot of bugs, especially around formatting. I could never tell how things were going to turn out and I always had to send myself a few previews to make sure that everything looked okay. Even when things did look decent in the email, they still weren’t exactly beautiful on the web archive. There were sometimes separate issues there. As someone who has spent a lot of time in QA, I found the issues to be somewhat maddening.</p>
<p>Beyond the formatting issues, this latest issue of Christman’s newsletter, <em>The Tourist</em> provides an interesting look at the Episcopalian debate around making references to God in their book of common prayer gender-neutral. Christman has thoughts on both sides of the debate.</p>
<p>I recently ran into the gender-neutralization of prayer when at a church event. We recited a prayer that I had said many times as a kid, “God is Great” (a common meal-time blessing). All of the male pronouns were replaced with simply the name of God, though, and I found myself out of step.</p>
<p>Another take on the discussions, from <a href="https://livingchurch.org/covenant/2018/07/09/a-bigger-conversation-about-liturgy/">A Bigger Conversation about Liturgy – Covenant</a>, laments the lack of collaboration with other faith traditions that characterize the current conversations around revisions (via <a href="https://micro.blog/ayjay">@ayjay</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This shouldn’t mean we just borrow the insights of other traditions as ritual toys. One of the faintly tragic elements on display in the 1979 Prayer Book are the numerous borrowings from Orthodox liturgy, which reflect not just scholarly knowledge, but prayerful conversations with Russian and Greek scholars of the mid-20th century who were then genuine dialogue partners. It is hard to find such engagement with eastern Christianity in the Episcopal Church now, beyond the somewhat hollow testimony of facsimile icons in Church bookstores.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the changes pass, and they are likely to, this will represent another point of division among Christian denominations. The question about whether the value of the changes warrant that unfortunate outcome has a very real and material impact on the body of Christian believers.</p>
<p>While Evangelicals are not likely to make prayers gender-neutral anytime soon, they are sometimes in favor of dropping <em>The Apostles Creed</em> from worship. Christ and Pop Culture <a href="https://christandpopculture.com/ben-myerss-the-apostles-creed-reminds-us-of-our-roots/">has a post</a> on a book by author Ben Myers about <em>The Apostles Creed</em>, arguing that it is ancient creeds like this that serve to unite Christians from different denominational (or even political) backgrounds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apostles-Creed-Catechism-Christian-Essentials/dp/1683590880">The Apostles’ Creed: A Guide to the Ancient Catechism</a>, Ben Myers beautifully articulates the significance of each line of the ancient creed. Even more helpful, Myers keeps one theme running throughout the small book: saying these words is significant not only because they communicate deep truth, but also because they connect us to the global, historic Christian church. There might be nothing more desperately needed in the American church today than the regular reminder that our greatest loyalty is not to our nation or our favored political party, but to fellow believers. Instead of being united by a set of shared political beliefs or geographic origins, we are most strongly united by our devotion to Christ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The objection some have to <em>The Apostles Creed</em> has to do with the line about the “holy catholic church” (that’s catholic with a small C, a reference to the universal church). As the piece points out, the problem with rejecting that reference pulls us out of the great cloud of witnesses that have gone before us, carrying the banner of the faith that has survived partly because of these flag bearers.</p>
<p>When we discuss these issues that serve to divide, let us keep in mind the words of the Apostle Paul in his first letter to the church in Corinth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought. My brothers and sisters, some from Chloe’s household have informed me that there are quarrels among you. What I mean is this: One of you says, “I follow Paul”; another, “I follow Apollos”; another, “I follow Cephas”; still another, “I follow Christ.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of Paul? I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, so no one can say that you were baptized in my name. (Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don’t remember if I baptized anyone else.) For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power. (<strong>1 Corinthians 1:10-17)</strong></p>

One quote particularly stood out amidst descriptions of the secrecy surrounding the site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>David Vosburgh, a retired construction worker, says he doesn&rsquo;t know anyone who has been hired there. He has lived in Maiden about 15 years, and says he unsuccessfully applied for a job at the data center.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Something is going on over there that they don&rsquo;t want people knowing,&rdquo; Vosburgh said in an interview last month. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re always building. They&rsquo;re very, very, very, very bad people. My opinion is they&rsquo;re terrible.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vosburgh doesn’t elaborate on why the Apple people are so bad, or at least the article did not capture his further thoughts on the subject. However, the piece does make clear that Apple was fined for violating some environmental regulations regarding waste disposal.</p>
<p>The whole situation has a very clandestine, conspiratorial vibe to it.</p>

			 <p>The main response I hear to the Netflix documentary series <strong>Wild Wild Country</strong> is disbelief that the events depicted in the show actually took place (in America, no less). Jen Chaney, from Vulture, <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2018/03/wild-wild-country-review.html">takes a stab at encapsulating the insanity</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a story that involves religion, free love, land use disputes, one of the co-founders of Nike, an exalted guru, abuse of power, arson, the wife of one of the producers of The Godfather, attempted murder, mass poisoning, an obsession with Rolls-Royces, the homeless, election battles, and one extremely bizarre anecdote about attempting to contaminate a town’s water supply using blended beaver parts. That is only the tip of the iceberg. “Someone will write a book about this,” an Oregon official says in footage that appears in episode one, “and I will guarantee you when that book comes out, people will say that it’s fiction.” In the ’80s, he couldn’t have imagined Netflix, or anticipated a docuseries like this one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s easy to see why a show including all of those elements would make for incredibly compelling television. The series is much more than mere spectacle, though. The stories woven within the broader narrative are so human, simultaneously relatable and repulsive. The brothers Way, makers of the documentary, weave a tale that declines to take sides in what amounted to a war between a free love fringe religious group and their small town mom and apple pie Oregonian neighbors. Each of the sides have their talking heads that are allowed plenty of screen time to comment on the various events that took place when Baghwan Shree Rajneesh and his followers moved onto a 60,000 acre ranch next to rural Antelope, OR.  The tales they tell drip with sadness, fear, happiness, elation, betrayal, naivety, love, hate, optimism and disappointment.</p>
<p>As a Christian, it’s hard for me to relate to a group who dresses in one color, follows a guru whose name (Baghwan) is god in Hindi and wear malas (necklaces that contain a picture of the guru). When they line up to greet the Rolls Royce caravan of Rajneesh with tears of joy, it looks a lot like worship, reminiscent of yet contrasting with the Palm Sunday story of Jesus entering Jerusalem on a donkey and being met with enthusiastic followers waving palms.  The purposeful displays of opulence that the guru engages in run counter to the teachings of most religions about how spiritual leaders are supposed to live. When people in both the East and the West picture a spiritual leader, we see asceticism the kind of which was eschewed by Rajneesh. Also troublesome is the free love version of human sexuality to which the group subscribed. Its opposition to traditional marriage and the aspirational narcissism of a relentless pursuit for individual enlightenment raises serious concerns about how children were raised. In fact, children are hardly mentioned in the documentary. These things can certainly be alienating to those of us who value ancient institutions that have shaped the fabric of society.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s easy to sympathize with the Rajneeshees in many ways. Most of the members could probably be most accurately described as “seekers” looking for a set of truths with which to frame their  world view. It’s not hard to imagine that the group of Rajneeshees might have been fairly harmless to its neighbors, had their presence been merely tolerated and not opposed outright. Most of the incidences of aggression or even suggested violence were responses to the US government or citizens blocking activities that were initiated by the group.  Ultimately, though, when faced with opposition, their primitive system of values proved deficient in that it didn’t have guide rails to prevent them from carrying heinous acts against outsiders or even themselves.</p>
<hr>
<p>Bonus points go to the series for being named after a line in a <a href="https://kottke.org/17/10/bill-callahan-the-only-sad-man-worth-loving">Bill Callahan</a> song and including music from him as well as Damien Jurado and other indie-folk heroes.</p>

			 <p>On this Independence Day, when we celebrate the birth of our nation and honor what that means to us, there is division in the air and on the ground. I find it a most appropriate time to bring discussion to the state of the union and I’m happy that the church to which I belong, the Presbyterian Church USA, <a href="https://www.wral.com/presbyterian-church-usa-takes-stand-on-political-issues/17659807/">recently clarified some political positions</a>. It is not mandated that all churches within the denomination to affirm the declaration that was made, but it is hoped that it will bring about some fruitful discussion and a careful consideration of where the Spirit is leading us as Christians.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As confessing Christians, we trust God, whom we know through Jesus Christ, in whose name we pray as others pray in other names.<br>
We are obligated to declare our concerns about the direction towards autocracy that our country is taking.<br>
We say Yes to God’s power of love and justice for the neighbor as well as the self, and we say No to demonic power that urges hate of the other, scatters blame, and creates civic discord.<br>
We say Yes to our imperfect democracy with one person, one vote, and No to any corruption of our elections.<br>
We say Yes to universal health care and No to care based on the ability to pay.<br>
We say Yes to safe schools, houses of worship, and public gathering places; and No to civilian access to assault and/or military-style weapons.<br>
We say Yes to core human values and No to dividing our humanity by ideology and partisanship.<br>
We say Yes to bridges and preservation of families and No to walls.<br>
We say Yes to affirming and celebrating the full spectra of human identity and No to discrimination and bigotry.<br>
We say: &lsquo;In life, and in death we belong to God.'&quot;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One thing that angers me a great deal is the misappropriation of passages from Holy Scripture. Tyler Huckabee <a href="https://relevantmagazine.com/culture/jeff-sessions-and-the-danger-of-using-the-bible-instead-of-letting-it-use-you/">writes in Relevent Magazine</a> on the dangers of dividing the Bible up into bite-size chunks appropriate for bumper sticker sloganeering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An unfortunate consequence of littering the Bible with the little demarcating numbers we call “chapter and verse” is the ease with which it allows the Bible to be split up piecemeal. We study and memorize the Bible in bite-sized chunks, just long enough to fit on a day calendar or scribble on a bathroom mirror. Chapters and verses are useful things for finding your place, but they can give the impression that each sentence of the Bible was spoken in a vacuum, with no pertinent information around it. Using Romans 13 to defend obeying the government, as Jeff Sessions did, is a bit like using Moby Dick to defend mid-1800s whaling practices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This particular moment in time has made it manifestly clear just how deficient a theology can be when it is built this way. Christians who claim to be adherents to the Bible seem to miss many of the themes that consistently run throughout the text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real secret of living according to the will of God is not to collect enough Bible verses to defend your latest socio-political fancy but to let God transform you entirely. Not to bend God’s Word to your will, but exactly the other way around. And to do that, you must take in the whole of Scripture, every jot and tittle. It’s not easy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huckabee is right that it’s not easy to get the bigger picture within scripture. That is why study is necessary and communities of faith are important.</p>

			 <p>Even as members and pastors have changed over the years, one complaint I’ve consistently heard about my church is that there are too many cliques. It’s an easy thing for a church culture to fall into. In fact, it may be impossible to avoid.</p>
<p>Research into human relationships has given us insight into the number of close personal connections a person can maintain. This limit is referred to as <em>Dunbar’s Number</em>.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First proposed by British Anthropologist Robin Dunbar, <strong>Dunbar&rsquo;s number</strong> is a suggested  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition">cognitive</a>  limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship">social relationships</a> —relationships in which an  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual">individual</a>  knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When thinking about relationships in a mid-sized church in the context of Dunbar’s Number, cliques are almost inevitable. Some churches seem to recognize this and embrace the concept within the institution by facilitating the formation of small groups. These small groups serve to anchor people within a number of manageable relationships in order to facilitate close bonds within the church. Rather than rejecting the cognitive limits of the human mind, these church’s have acknowledged those limits and given sanction to living within them.</p>
<p>I used to fault church members for not being welcoming enough. For some time after I joined the church, I felt somewhat left out. I didn’t feel like anyone was going out of their way to include me in their circle of friends. I faulted the church and the culture within it. One day I realized that, by holding church members to a higher standard than everyone else, I was setting myself up for disappointment. Humans who are members of a church are making a commitment to be better, more spiritual people. They’re not perfect, though. They are still bound by the same mental limitations that are part of being in the human race. Those limitations make it hard to go out of our way to expand our social circles (this is obviously harder for some than others). Every Sunday, we make a corporate confession of sins and acknowledge our unwillingness or inability to rise above them. We are all burdened by sin, imperfection and limitations. How could I have believed otherwise?</p>

			 <p>Justin Lee at Arc Digital <a href="https://arcdigital.media/has-apple-legally-sabotaged-itself-3b1560f626a2">argues that</a> Apple is painting itself into a corner by arguing for a strict interpretation of the constitutional right to free speech in the Masterpiece case. Previously, when the FBI asked Apple to create software to neutralize security features on the iPhone, Apple argued that the order was compelled speech and that source code should be included in free speech protections. In doing so, Apple was advocating for a very broad interpretation of the free speech provision of the first amendment. The new position seems contradictory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Such an outcome would satisfy the social justice concerns of Apple and other corporate giants, but it wouldn’t necessarily be good for business. A definition of speech narrow enough to exclude decorative arts will almost certainly exclude source code as well. The FBI could easily use such a precedent in court to compel Apple to write code capable of breaching their iPhone users’ privacy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Will this prove damaging to Apple&rsquo;s legal concerns in the future?</p>

			 <p>From Christ and Pop Culture on <a href="https://christandpopculture.com/what-the-nfl-and-the-church-can-learn-from-the-nba/">how the NFL has handled the player’s protesting</a> by kneeling during the national anthem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By excluding the NFLPA from this decision, the owners are accepting the false narrative that the protests are against America and the military. These dismissive actions demonstrate that owners have shown little concern about the injustices and inequalities the players were attempting to highlight. Instead, their demand to end the protests seems to only come from a concern for their bottom-line profits. The problem with this approach, beyond the suppression of the rights outlined in the First Amendment, is that it makes explicit what has been implicit for some time — most NFL owners care more about maintaining power and wealth than the health, welfare, and safety of their players.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The president’s and vice president’s interference in this space has been dishonest and unwelcome. The way the NFL has handled the peaceful and respectful protests has been uneven at best and racist and coercive at worst.</p>
<p>Add this to the cover-up and mishandling of the issue of players with brain injuries and you have some very good reasons for not supporting the National Football League.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One of the most rage inducing/heartbreaking things I’ve read this past week is that Kelly Marie Tran, who played Rose in <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44379473">removed her posts from Instagram</a>. The action was most likely due to harassment Tran has been the recipient of for the last few months. Since shortly after the film’s debut, she has faced racist and sexist abuse online.</p>
<p>A certain segment of Star Wars devotees proved to be too attached to the series after the prequels failed to live up to expectations. I’ll have to admit to feeling let down by Star Wars 1-3 and I think there is <a href="http://frostedechoes.com/2018/06/06/making-peace-with.html">legitimate reason to be concerned about where the series is headed</a>. However, most of us long-time fans know where to draw the line between disappointment and outrage.</p>
<p>Now a set of fans has taken advantage of the social media tools that let them spew venom at the objects of their derision. These fans feel like they are entitled to a Star Wars that affirms their views of the world. Anything other than that registers like a betrayal to them. For these people, movies that were meant to be entertainment instead become sacred. Fairy tales in space become outsized in their importance and take on a idealized purity that is easily stained in the messy work of continuing the narrative. It’s truly a shame to see Tran and others taking part in what should be a wonderful experience of sharing a story with the world become the victims of online abuse.</p>

			 <p>I was only a few years old when the Star Wars trilogy first came to theaters, and the movies and toys tied to them had a formative role in how I used my imagination. I played Jedi training with my cousin on the playground, my dad and I used plastic baseball bats and pretended they were lightsabers, and different spots in my basement became their own planets as action figures shuttled between them in tiny space ships. I remember being in a Toys R’ Us once, and trying to convince my mom that I should be allowed to buy a third Darth Vader action figure, after the first two both suffered through their oversized heads falling off of their lithe bodies.</p>
<p>It’s probably safe to say my life was begun in Star Wars fandom. However, I’m becoming increasingly convinced that <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/star-wars-celebration-lucasfilm-story-group/">the powers steering Star Wars</a> want to make me hate the franchise by the time I die. After the original three movies, fans experienced a long drought that left us parched and thirsty for more adventures from a galaxy far far away. However, after purchasing the franchise, Disney seems to want us to drown in Star Wars excess.</p>
<p>The rumors and announcements of the future direction of the Star Wars movies don’t offer much hope for an old-school fan. The director of the latest film, <em>The Last Jedi</em>, Rian Johnson, who decided to omit or trash the mythology his predecessor cued up in the previous film, <a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/11/rian-johnson-to-create-new-star-wars-trilogy/">is being given his own series of Star Wars movies</a>.  The creators of the <em>Game of Thrones</em> series, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, are also <a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/02/game-of-thrones-creators-david-benioff-and-d-b-weiss-to-write-and-produce-new-star-wars-movies/">being given their own series of movies</a> within the Star Wars universe. At this point, it feels like Disney is giving directors their own Star Wars movies like an English monarch handing out titles.</p>
<p>The last two directors to receive titles, though, are particularly interesting picks. Most of us remember wincing or groaning when we rewatched Leia kissing Luke in <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, knowing that they would eventually be revealed to be siblings. With Benioff and Weiss being tapped to helm a new series of Star Wars movies, viewers are likely to see <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/allenstjohn/2014/04/28/rape-incest-and-redemption-the-questionable-moral-compass-of-game-of-thrones/#5bb151b44ddc">siblings doing much more perverse things</a> than mere kissing. Incest is so common on <em>Game of Thrones</em> that Forbes magazine had an article titled <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/08/31/game-of-thrones-incest-scene-jon-snow-dany/">Why We Secretly Love the Incest on Game of Thrones</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps a little less worrying, at least in terms of the creative team, is the news about the new Star Wars series that is set to appear on the upcoming Disney streaming service. For the series, the stewards of the franchise have tapped <a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/03/jon-favreau-to-executive-produce-and-write-live-action-star-wars-tv-series/">Jon Favreau to direct</a>. Favreau has come a long way since playing Mike, the character who inadvisedly decided not to double-down, in the indie hit <em>Swingers</em>. His credentials are fairly impressive. Still, one has to wonder if a streaming show to binge and multiple movie series are what Star Wars fans need.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also came to understand the depth and diversity of roles that a film can play in someone’s life: it could be a mere amusement or a guiding force, your best friend or your nemesis, your muse or your medicine. Even the most maligned movie can distract a person from contemplating the void as they face certain and fast-approaching death, or it can try to fill the hole that’s left when that person’s gone.</p>

<p>It’s a very personal piece that shows how a movie experience can be seen from many different angles. Touching on her grandfather’s decline and the running half-joke that was his enduring fascination with one of the most hated benign characters in the cinematic universe, Kurchak hits at how powerfully context shapes the value we get from an artistic creation.</p>

			 <p>After literally working with town officials for years on a new site for a store, IKEA has <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article211750844.html#emlnl=Breaking_Newsletter">just cancelled their plans</a> to build a location in Cary NC. Since the town had been planning a lot of changes that hinge on the arrival of the new store, I’m sure those that had worked on the deal and all of the concessions that had to be obtained are seriously frustrated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When I asked whether there was anything Cary could do to influence IKEA’s decision, I was told that there was nothing; not even an incentive would make a difference,&rdquo; Stegall said in his statement. &ldquo;IKEA said they had an extremely positive view of and experience with the Town Council, our staff, the mall site, and Cary as a whole. The bottom line is that as wonderful a place as Cary is, we are just too suburban for IKEA’s new direction. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure how Cary is going to revitalize the old shopping mall that IKEA was going to essentially replace but I hope they have a contingency plan.</p>

			 <p>Tedium <a href="https://tedium.co/2018/05/22/windows-fake-osx-macos-interface-skins-history/">has the backstory</a> on a movement that took place in the aughts to make Windows machines look like they were running the Mac OS. During that decade, there were plenty of reasons to be running a Windows box instead of a Mac (not the least of which was cost). There was something so sleek and attractive about OS X that just made people wish the user interface on their Windows PC looked a bit more like the Mac.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But something about the chrome-laden interface, one that Steve Jobs spoke of in terms of “fit and finish,” really put the system in a different place. Sure, there were other operating systems that held a certain kind of appeal during the era, but Mac OS X was different. It was a bit over-the-top, like the early iMacs in their Bondi Blue cases, and that boldness spoke to people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It wasn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but enough teacups were being served that it was clear that it would eventually be one of the biggest selling points for the Mac. And eventually, thanks to the mainstream success of the iPod and the iPhone, plenty more teacups would be served after that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To meet the demand, a number of options popped up to reskin Windows to appear to be running OS X. While I tried quite a few of the tools mentioned in the article with my Windows machines back in the day, the customizations never stuck. The screenshots of these skinned desktops looked so great, but I would inevitably find holes in the OS that weren&rsquo;t skinned and didn&rsquo;t look right. That bothered me to the point of abandoning the whole effort and sticking with the default Windows skins. It&rsquo;s worth noting, though, that Microsoft made some effort to encourage customization of the UI, whereas Apple has done everything they can to squash it. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to make any meaningful UI customizations on MacOS at this point, whereas a quick peruse through a GUI customization site like <a href="http://digitalvanity.me/">Digital Vanity</a> shows that people are still modding Windows in interesting ways.</p>

<p><strong>I’m not a lifestyle guru.</strong> You probably won’t see a post with a listicle on 11 ways to hack your sleep on this blog. I do, however, have a practice that I have used and want to share about managing bedtime. Specifically, how you can manage devices when it’s time to go to sleep and how you disconnect.</p>
<p>I recently implemented a Disney Circle device, which allows you to manage wifi devices and usage profiles for each individual in your house. With the circle, I can manage how much internet time my kids get each day and can apply even more granularity to the usage of things like the major social networks. Fortunately, my kids haven’t gotten to the stage where they have a desire to use the social networks. I’ll enjoy that for as long as it can hold.</p>
<p>The Circle is not only for the benefit of my children, though. It also helps my wife and I to maintain more healthy internet habits. I spend too much of my life looking at a computer screen during the day in a building leased from Red Hat. I need to detach from the screen at some point during the course of evening. Or be forced to do so, if necessary. That is where the Circle comes in. I used to have my WiFi router set to turn off at 9pm, but that became problematic when I my wife and I were watching something on Netflix and it ran just a little bit longer than we expected. Enter the Circle, with its device or user-specific settings. I am now able to restrict only our mobile devices at 9pm (7:30 pm for the little guys) and I don’t have to worry about the Apple TV.</p>
<p>One thing I like about this method is that I don’t have to put away my device completely. I happily read articles that are saved to Pocket on my iPad, for instance. The difference, though, is I’m much more focused and intentional and there are bounds to my consumption. Once I’ve read the articles I’ve saved, that’s it. There are no opportunities to go down a hyperlinked rathole. I’m not going to find myself scrolling down an infinite list of Instagram picks that are curated by a machine to appeal to me. I won’t get engaged in some Twitter rant thread and go to bed angry.</p>
<p>At the risk of overstating the point, how you manage your internet access can have a major impact on your life and your relationships. With so much work having gone into making your device seem like the best way to spend your limited attention, most people need some kind of barrier to overuse. I recently talked to a friend who had been battling with his wife over his child’s YouTube usage. His wife made the point that they needed to rely on the child to curb his own internet usage. To expect an 11-year-old to have the necessary willpower to combat the tricks and techniques of the technology industry is too much. Adults have a hard enough time with technology withdrawal, and kids are especially vulnerable. Ultimately, it’s best to have some kind of system in place to prevent excessive internet exposure.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that the Circle is not a truly end-to-end solution for device management. It can only control internet access through wifi. So, if your kids (or you) are overindulging on games, and those games do not require a constant internet connection, you have to find another solution to keep that behavior in check.</p>

<p><strong>This past week, Alto’s Odyssey, the sequel to the much lauded iOS game Alto’s Adventure, was released to positive reviews.</strong> Alto’s Adventure offers a take on the “endless runner” game that gives a snowboarder a vast natural playground for collecting coins and doing simple tricks. Odessey isn’t a brand new experience, but rather builds upon its predecessor in innovative ways.</p>
<p>What interests me about the Alto’s franchise is how people use the games in a therapeutic way. Several folks have written about Alto’s Adventure as a meditative experience and a treatment for anxiety.</p>

			 <p>Van Halen&rsquo;s debut record recently celebrated its fortieth birthday. Consequence of Sound <!-- raw HTML omitted -->featured an article<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wren Graves<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, on the record and the culture that made it possible. I was struck by the observation Graves makes that much of the band&rsquo;s antics at the time wouldn&rsquo;t be tolerated today.</p>
<p>Late-70&rsquo;s Van Halen were flamboyant and full of themselves. Some of their higher-profile hijinks are the stuff of legend. In those days, there were a few rock stars that were notorious for trashing hotel rooms. Van Halen took it to the next level and trashed the whole seventh floor of a hotel in Madison, Wisconsin. The band was infamous for their pretentious tour riders demanding a bowl of M&amp;M’s with all of the brown ones taken out. Van Halen&rsquo;s cocaine and heroin use was well known and just considered part of their persona.</p>
<p>Graves writes about the difference in public perception of such behavior between now and then.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I personally think the lack of tolerance for such behavior is mostly a good thing. I don&rsquo;t want to see hedonistic, well-heeled rock stars trashing hotels, glamorizing drug use and marching toward self-destruction under the gaze of impressionable youth. What fascinates me, though, is thinking about the broader cultural trends under which allowed the arena rock bands to engage in such behavior with very little career-damaging repercussions.</p>
<p>When I was in college, in the mid-90&rsquo;s, a good friend of mine used to complain about his dislike of Christianity, because its tight morality was keeping him restricted from living the life he wanted to live. Since he was living a carefree college lifestyle, regularly getting hammered at bars downtown and occasionally even sleeping with girls he didn&rsquo;t know, I asked him what Christians were preventing him from doing. He didn&rsquo;t have an answer to that.</p>
<p>Some say we are now living in a post-Christian era in the US. It&rsquo;s ironic that, in this post-Christian era, the outrage culture of the internet has created a new moral orthodoxy. In some ways, this new orthodoxy is most restrictive than any religious-based moral code we have seen in recent times. Those who transgress, or step outside of the bounds of what is considered acceptable, find themselves subjected to punishing levels of scorn and derision. All of this is fueled and enabled by a level of technological interconnectedness the likes of which we have never previously seen.</p>

			 <p>Smart speakers are becoming ubiquitous. Apple finally released their entry into this increasingly crowded market with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->well-reviewed HomePod<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Streaming services, most notably Spotify and Apple Music, are in their ascendancy, having each added tens of millions of paying subscribers over the last couple of years.

<p>While the vinyl market is still slowly growing, and new vinyl pressing plants are opening, the once-beloved compact disc seems to be on its way out. The latest blow to the format is that Best Buy, which was once one of the largest retailers of music, is getting rid of their shelf space for CD’s this year. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->An article from Consequence of Sound<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reveals the details.<br>

<p>Another big box retailer mentioned in the article, that is striking a blow to the CD, is Target. They still plan to stock compact discs, but are trying to force the records labels into a deal where the labels will have to buy back any unsold inventory. This is an interesting turn of events. When the record labels held the power and wanted to push retailers into switching from the vinyl record to the higher-margin compact disc, they offered buy backs on unsold CD’s but not on records. I guess the shoe is on the other foot now and the retailers have the upper hand.<br>

			 <p>For a few years now, I’ve followed a “read the Bible in a year” program. Last year, I used the plan from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bible Class Material<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which presents the readings in a more-or-less chronological order that I’ve found extremely helpful for following the Old Testament material.</p>
<p>Every year that I have read the Bible, I have gained new insights and different passages have stuck out to me in different ways. It’s been a new experience, each time. Heraclitus said that “a man never stands in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.” This has perhaps rarely been more apparent to me than when wading through the river of life-giving waters that is holy scripture. When I bring to the reading fresh experiences from my own life, I see the verses through different eyes.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Art by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sharon Hinchliffe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Flickr - Also available through Etsy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as a print<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>This year, one of the books I have discovered anew is the book of Jonah. Famous as being one of the most kid-friendly books of the Bible, Jonah has a lot more to it than the children’s adaptations present. Most of us are familiar with this Sunday School depiction of Jonah as the reluctant prophet, called to a foreign city to preach about God, attempting to run away from the task to which he is called and ending up in a “big fish.” After his encounter with the fish, Jonah realizes he can’t escape God’s will for him and does indeed travel on to Nineveh. However, most of the “Jonah and the whale” stories for younger children omit the the fourth and final chapter of the book completely. If you can put aside the whole guy getting swallowed by a big fish and having a change of heart thing, the last chapter is where the book of Jonah really gets interesting.</p>
<p>It is well understood from any reading of the story that Jonah fiercely resisted God’s command to go to Nineveh. If we put ourselves in the place of Jonah, the command from God was like being asked to go to Mosul under ISIS control and preach repentance. In fact, the city of Nineveh, to which Jonah was called, was located in the area of the modern day city of Mosul. The Ninevites had been brutal to the Israelites, as the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->carvings from Lachish<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attest (be sure not to miss the guys getting flayed alive). Not only did Jonah not want to go, but, as is revealed in the fourth chapter, Jonah didn’t actually want the Ninevites to repent. He wanted them to end up as toast, deserving recipients of the righteous wrath of God.</p>
<p>However, surprisingly enough, the Ninevites did heed the prophecy from the Lord that their city would be destroyed if they didn’t repent and turn from their ways. Jonah was far from being happy about this outcome. The successful prophet turns his back on God again, this time angry that the citizens of Nineveh actually listened to his warnings and were spared from the punishment they so richly deserved. Jonah’s despair causes him to wish for his life to end, there in the desert, under the hot sun. Instead, in a single day, God makes a tree that grows to a height that shields Jonah from the scorching rays. After having endured the sun’s punishing heat, Jonah is more than happy to accept God’s gift. However, the next day, the tree has withered, causing Jonah to complain bitterly. God responds by reminding Jonah that he has made the people and animals of Nineveh just as he has made the tree.</p>
<p>The message that we can take away from the book of Jonah is that the creator God makes, and yes, even cherishes, our enemies. It’s a bold and disconcerting lesson. It likely brings us no more comfort than it brought Jonah. We should keep the book of Jonah in mind when we read that Jesus taught us to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us. There is a consistency of thought there stretching from the prophets of the Old Testament to the teachings of the Son of God in the New Testament. It’s almost as if, though not many people, if any at all, can actually follow these teachings, they help us to understand the heart of God. They help to shape our perception of how who God is and what He values.</p>

			 <p>I recently mentioned to my boss that I’m used to metrics being involved in my work. I’m used to decisions being made based on data. I’ve taken it for granted that enterprise organizations like to be able to measure things that may impact profitability. The last few jobs I’ve worked out were pretty rigorous in tracking certain metrics.</p>
<p>However, in my personal life, I’m not into self-quantification. Even at the height of their popularity, I never wanted a FitBit. I feel like I can get the benefits of exercise without counting my steps. Similarly, I feel that I can eat well without counting calories. Probably the best rules for simply eating well come from Michael Pollen:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It isn’t hard to follow those rules (or it shouldn’t be, at least). You don’t need an app to do it.</p>
<p>As I write more this year, I appreciate one of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2018 liberations of blogger Aleen Simms<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I also appreciate what Manton Reece is trying to do with his service Micro.blog. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->His response<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to Simms liberation is this:<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the spirit of Reece’s philosophy, does the fact that my Medium blog, as of now, has a big fat goose egg for the number of followers color people’s responses to it? Does it make visitors ascribe less value to it than they would other, similar blogs on Medium? I know, from my stats, that people have been reading the posts, but not all of them are active on Medium. Even some who have liked the posts haven’t followed the publication.</p>
<p>If you are conducting a MailChimp marketing campaign, metrics on how customers are interacting with your communication make sense. You need to know what strategies are generating interest. Do the same sort of metrics make sense for a personal blog, though? Having hooked up Google Analytics, which offers an array of metrics, to a personal blog, I can say that for me, the answer is no. The most interesting thing I learned through Google Analytics were the geographic locations from where the hits my blog was receiving came. As much as I like external validation (who doesn’t?), I’m not sure I need to offer readers the ability to like my tweets, my Instagram photos and my blog posts.</p>
<p>For the social networks, the ability to like posts make a bit more sense than the ability to like, for instance, a WordPress blog post. Often times, when you post a link to a blog post from a social network, your friends will indicate that they like it on the platform where they saw the link. Which is affirming, but for traffic that comes to your blog from other sources, it looks like no one likes your post. That is not really a big deal, except that a platform like Medium makes kind of a show of their version of likes (claps). They <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to do this, because their business model is now based around claps. If you publish stories only to Medium members, as part of their Partners Program, the number of claps you receive determines the amount of compensation you get for the story. It’s a pretty ingenious way of rewarding content that people find valuable. However, it doesn’t really work as well for those of us who are just writing to put thoughts out there, with no dreams or aspirations of ever getting paid for that writing.</p>
<p>When I find myself checking the stats on something I have put out there, I’m reminded that it might be better to liberate myself from the need for validation. Perhaps I can learn to simply put something out there and move on to the next project. It would be nice to have tools that support that goal.</p>

			 <p>Austin Kleon writes about his take on copyright law <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Since Kleon published a book titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Steal Like An Artist<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, he encounters a lot of people who assume he is against copyright. He assures the reader that he is not against copyright protections for intellectual property. He does, however, believe that art builds on prior art.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Art reflects life and life reflects art. If art is impactful, it inspires others to make art. It used to be said that everyone who heard the Velvet Underground went out and started a band. That’s what art does. It inspires others to create. I use art here in a very broad sense, meaning everything from painting to skateboarding to making spaceships out of LEGO bricks.</p>
<p>I have struggled with the concept of artistic appropriation myself. There are times when I feel like all of my ideas are just born on the back of someone else’s work. Frequently I see something that has been created by someone else and wonder if I can do something similar and put my own spin on it. There’s a kind of guilt in that, though. It’s as if I expect myself to come up with creative works ex nihilo (out of nothing), regardless of how unrealistic that is. To underscore the difficulty of coming up with something completely new, Amanda Petrusich, writing for the New Yorker, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->examines just how hard it is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to make original music these days. She uses the example of a white noise recording being scrutinized for plagiarism.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Maybe we can all stop pretending that we can generally create art that owes nothing to its influences. I like the way that Petrusich puts it when she writes, “Yet there’s something lovely and comforting about the continuum—about art begetting art, about a pulse traveling down a line.”</p>

			 <p>When I was in Walt Disney World earlier this year, the Hall of Presidents in Liberty Square in the Magic Kingdom was being updated to include a new animatronic Donald Trump. The event was closed for the update and I wondered how everything would turn out.</p>
<p>Donald Trump rarely says things that inspire us. More often, he is inarticulate and boastful. He routinely says things that divide Americans and sound petty, at best. In my mind, seeing that the hall was closed for the addition of his representation, I had to ask myself what they were going to have him say. Obviously, Disney would have to put the best possible face on the current President of the United States. But could even the best imaginations in the world pull off such a feat?</p>
<p>It turns out I need not have worried. Even faced with animating a president with such a dearth of good material, the fine folks at Disney have given us something presidential. In fact, the animatronic version of the 45th president comes off as a much better version of the man. It kind of makes you wonder how things would be different if reality imitated art. What would it look like if Donald Trump had become more presidential, as he took office, like his supporters hoped he would?</p>

			 <p>When I first saw the headline that Moogfest (which occurs annually right down the street from my house) would be featuring a 2018 lineup led by female, non-binary and transgender artists and would feature a keynote by Chelsea Manning, I was a little surprised. Moogfest has always attempted to be cutting edge, even to the point of hubris, but the new strategy just didn’t make sense.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> By Judah Gross (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finding love at MOOGFEST<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) via Wikimedia Commons</p>
<p>I found myself wondering: What relation does gender have to music in that it should be an exclusionary or disqualifying factor in whether you play a synthesizer festival? I confess that I wasn’t familiar with most of the artists mentioned in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->article about the lineup<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. One name did stick out to me, though. Chairlift singer Caroline Polachek (playing as CEP) was named as one of the promised performers. I’ve been listening to Chairlift for a few years now. I consider their 2012 album <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Something<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as a independent synth pop masterpiece, with an abundance of hooks that make it accessible to anyone. I found myself wondering if Polachek met any of the criteria for the Moogfest grouping, other than being female.</p>
<p>Apparently Polachek <!-- raw HTML omitted -->took issue<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with the announcement, as well, stating that gender is “not a genre.”<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Polachek subsequently pulled out of Moogfest 2018. The organizers of the festival were very graceful about the exit, even sending an apology letter to Polachek, which clarified that their intention was not to take the focus off of the art.</p>
<p>It seems this is becoming a more common scenario. Those that are traditionally viewed as marginalized are given special status. The intentions are good, but there are two possible negative outcomes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As the potential audience for the festival, I have to say my preference for the lineup would be one of all around inclusiveness that makes the music the primary criteria for choosing the lineup.</p>

			 <p>Listening to twee pop from South America and feeling nostalgic about the 90’s was not how I planned on spending a sick and tired Monday night. Yet, there I found myself, eyes glued to yet another screen, soaking up sounds from a far away place and digging into information about a scene I never knew existed.</p>
<p>It started out when I saw an Instagram post about a rerelease of a record by South American disco pioneer Junior Mendes posted by Bandcamp (that website is an international treasure). Since Instagram doesn’t allow hyperlinks in posts, I navigated over to the Bandcamp site to do a search for the record. As often happens with the internet, I saw a piece that distracted me from my original search and got sucked down a rabbit hole. The piece that drew my attention was a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bandcamp Daily feature<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about Gatitx Discos, a Central/South American noise pop record label that just released a compilation showcasing their artists. The artists hail from Chile, Peru and Argentina and draw heavily on early 1990’s UK and US indie pop for inspiration. The music on Gatitx Records sounds intentionally <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very different<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than the cumbia and reggaeton stuff that you typically hear coming out of that part of the world. The first track to which the article calls your attention is a song called “Husker Dü” by the band Peruvian band Gatxs Monteses.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The low-budget DIY attitude helps to explain the garagey feel of the music. All of the tracks from Gatitx Disco that I sampled had a distinctly lo-fi feel that took me back to my late high school and early college days listening to bands on labels like Sub Pop, Merge and Matador Records. It felt refreshing, because even indie music tends to have such a polished sound these days.</p>
<p>I knew that I should have turned off my iPad and rested, but I kept clicking to sample the next band. I wanted to hear how accurate the blurbs about the bands were in their comparisons to the luminaries of an earlier age of indie pop. It turns out that they didn’t stray far from the mark.
For example, take a listen to “Perfect Date” from Kawaiimaster420. You are sure to pick up on the J. Mascis guitars. If you were weaned on Dinosaur Jr., it should make you feel the urge to put <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Green Mind<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the turntable.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Argentinian band Ice Cream Ü effectively channels Superchunk in their track “Patio” from the full length <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Un Espacio Entre Portales<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The track “Paracaidistas” by Jardinería del Mar sounds like something from early K Records and features nice call and response boy/girl vocals.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I spent longer than I should have going through the Gatitx Discos catalog. If you are looking for something different and maybe a trip down memory lane, checkout the article and the bands featured. Most of the full-lengths that I listened to were name your price, so they represent a great opportunity to get into the sounds the kids to the south of us are making.</p>
<p>Also, the Junior Mendes record that Bandcamp was promoting was nowhere to be found on their site. That&rsquo;s just the way that the internet works.</p>

			 <p>Today was one of those days. Down with a cold and unable to do much, I spent much of the day in bed and moping about the house. Then the mail came, and brought with it two new records from the Sounds Delicious series. I had been eagerly anticipating hearing Frankie Rose cover the Cure and almost immediately put it on the turntable.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The cover of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seventeen Seconds<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is glorious. Although Seventeen seconds has never been my favorite album by the Cure, I can appreciate the atmospherics and the Factory Records sound of the LP.  Rose doesn&rsquo;t stray too far from the source material in her recording, which makes sense, given her love of the original.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can read more about the LP on the Sounds Delicious site <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Hearing the cover of &ldquo;A Forest&rdquo; that was released a couple of months ago, and seeing Rose&rsquo;s former band Beverly live at the Local 506 made me want to look deeper into her catalogue. I&rsquo;m glad I did, because her most recent album (excepting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seventeen Seconds<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cage Tropical<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is easily one my favorites to come out this year.</p>
<p>On <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cage Tropical<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, you can hear the Cure influence on Rose&rsquo;s original music, as well as a bit of the Cocteau Twins, but the songs are more than mere rehash. Rose uses not only her musical influences on the album, but bits of yet-to-be-created sci-fi worlds, as well. However, she always treats the songwriting with as much care as the atmosphere, and the album rewards the listener for her efforts. </p>
