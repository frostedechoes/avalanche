As I detailed in <a href=\"https://frostedechoes.com/2022/03/30/writing-for-an.html\">this post about writing online</a>, readers now want to be able to receive your writing in different mediums.

Among those delivery mechanisms, Birchler&rsquo;s post seems to only consider the web and RSS. His point is mainly that you should never change your URL or your RSS feed, if you can avoid it.

In contrast to the web and RSS, where your reader is fetching from your site, with email and newsletters, you are pushing your output to them. This puts less of a strain on your readers to follow you wherever you go. Instead of them having to take action to go <em>with you</em>, they just need to <em>be there</em> for the journey.

He writes that he hears questions about this topic more than anything else.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Over the past few years, I’ve been asked one question more than any other. It comes up at speeches, at dinners, in conversation. It’s the most popular query when I open my podcast to suggestions, time and again. It comes in two forms. The first: Should I have kids, given the climate crisis they will face? The second: Should I have kids, knowing they will contribute to the climate crisis the world faces?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Klein concludes that these fears are not well-founded and that those who know the most about climate change do not have the same level of concern about the issue.</p>\n<p>In a piece called <a href=\"https://www.plough.com/en/topics/justice/culture-of-life/the-new-malthusians\">The New Malthusians</a> by Lyman Stone, the writer and demographer focuses on climate change as a reason for not having kids.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A recent survey conducted by the <em>New York Times</em> found that a third of fertility-age women say climate-change fears are among the reasons why they have not had children yet. Meanwhile, groups like Birthstrike encourage women to take what might be called the “Lysistrata option”: boycott having a child until climate policy improves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He also writes more generally about people&rsquo;s concerns around having kids.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whenever I write about fertility, someone inevitably responds on Twitter with some variation of, “But do you realize how bad the world is? Who would want to be born into this?” The source of the badness varies. Sometimes it is climate change. Sometimes it is Republicans. Sometimes it’s immigrants and sometimes it’s socialists.

				"content_text": "![](https://frostedechoes.com/uploads/2022/8a691b5ce6.jpg)\n\nI wrote in a recent newsletter about [an article that Ezra Klein published,](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/05/opinion/climate-change-should-you-have-kids.html) in which he discusses how often he hears from people who don’t think it’s a good idea to have kids due to climate change. He writes that he hears questions about this topic more than anything else.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n> Over the past few years, I’ve been asked one question more than any other. It comes up at speeches, at dinners, in conversation. It’s the most popular query when I open my podcast to suggestions, time and again. It comes in two forms. The first: Should I have kids, given the climate crisis they will face? The second: Should I have kids, knowing they will contribute to the climate crisis the world faces?\n\nKlein concludes that these fears are not well-founded and that those who know the most about climate change do not have the same level of concern about the issue. \n\nIn a piece called [The New Malthusians](https://www.plough.com/en/topics/justice/culture-of-life/the-new-malthusians) by Lyman Stone, the writer and demographer focuses on climate change as a reason for not having kids. \n\n> A recent survey conducted by the *New York Times* found that a third of fertility-age women say climate-change fears are among the reasons why they have not had children yet. Meanwhile, groups like Birthstrike encourage women to take what might be called the “Lysistrata option”: boycott having a child until climate policy improves. \n\nHe also writes more generally about people's concerns around having kids. \n\n> Whenever I write about fertility, someone inevitably responds on Twitter with some variation of, “But do you realize how bad the world is? Who would want to be born into this?” The source of the badness varies. Sometimes it is climate change. Sometimes it is Republicans. Sometimes it’s immigrants and sometimes it’s socialists. People of all stripes have their reasons for why it would be better never to be born, but the striking thing is how free more and more Americans seem to feel to express that life is fundamentally bad, that on the grand scale of being, nonexistence is better than existence. This is a very real cultural change; it shows movement toward our becoming a society of despair.\n\nWe may be living in a society of despair, or it may just be a society that has a great deal of reproductive pessimism. I think you can probably find ample evidence for both, but [the way population replacement has plummeted](https://frostedechoes.com/2022/04/06/populations-in-the.html) in the last few years makes a forceful case for the latter. \n\n_(📷 Image Source: [broombesoom on Flickr](https://flic.kr/p/BgcnWd))_\n\n",

In fact, sometimes I can&rsquo;t understand the depths that people go to in their dissection of these series. I grew up on shows like <em>Knight Rider</em>, <em>Wonder Woman</em>, <em>The Dukes of Hazzard</em>, <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, etc. Has anyone watched these shows recently and done a comparison to what we have available now? The difference is <em>stark</em>. On <em>Buck Rogers</em>, the droid would waddle around saying, &ldquo;beedee beedee beedee.&rdquo; That was supposed to transport us to this future of robots and interplanetary travel we could all hardly imagine. It isn&rsquo;t just the special effects, either. The storylines and level of drama on these new shows are light years ahead of what we watched back then on TV. Shows on streaming services have a cinematic quality bar they jump over that we never would have dreamed of shows hurdling in those days.</p>\n<p>Into this discussion comes the trailer for the soon-to-be-released Star Wars series, <em>Andor</em>. Given how much I liked <em>Rogue One</em>, I&rsquo;ve been very eager to see this show about its protagonist come to fruition. The preview to which we have been treated looks astonishing.

Even though *Obi-Wan Kenobi* seemed to be a success story, it had its share of detractors as well. \n\n<!--more-->\n\n![](https://frostedechoes.com/uploads/2022/486ce74336.png)\n\nWhile it may not make writing about these shows as interesting, I have had a lot of fun watching all the Star Wars entries into episodic television. In fact, sometimes I can't understand the depths that people go to in their dissection of these series. I grew up on shows like _Knight Rider_, _Wonder Woman_, _The Dukes of Hazzard_, _Battlestar Galactica_, etc. Has anyone watched these shows recently and done a comparison to what we have available now? The difference is _stark_. On _Buck Rogers_, the droid would waddle around saying, \"beedee beedee beedee.\" That was supposed to transport us to this future of robots and interplanetary travel we could all hardly imagine. It isn't just the special effects, either. The storylines and level of drama on these new shows are light years ahead of what we watched back then on TV. Shows on streaming services have a cinematic quality bar they jump over that we never would have dreamed of shows hurdling in those days. \n\nInto this discussion comes the trailer for the soon-to-be-released Star Wars series, *Andor*. Given how much I liked *Rogue One*, I've been very eager to see this show about its protagonist come to fruition. The preview to which we have been treated looks astonishing. Action, intrigue, moral considerations, transcendent worldbuilding: it seems to check all of these boxes and more. \n\n![](https://frostedechoes.com/uploads/2022/c0add036d2.jpg)\n\n→ [Andor - Official Disney+ Trailer](https://youtu.be/cKOegEuCcfw)\n\n\n",

Before too long, though, you find yourself entranced by the saccharine sweetness of American lead singer Krissy Vanderwoude&rsquo;s vocals, which bring to mind Velocity Girl&rsquo;s Sarah Shannon. As Vanderwoude sings about &ldquo;kindness, patience and grace,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s marvelous to get a little twee go along with the richness of her honeyed tone.</p>\n<p>I liked last year&rsquo;s single, &ldquo;Grounded&rdquo; by the band, but there&rsquo;s nothing of the bite from that song here. I could easily imagine &ldquo;Always There&rdquo; as a feature track on a 1992 episode of 120 Minutes and Churchhill Garden perhaps opening for peak-of-their-powers era Lush.

Before too long, though, you find yourself entranced by the saccharine sweetness of American lead singer Krissy Vanderwoude's vocals, which bring to mind Velocity Girl's Sarah Shannon. As Vanderwoude sings about \"kindness, patience and grace,\" it's marvelous to get a little twee go along with the richness of her honeyed tone. \n\n<!--more-->\n\nI liked last year's single, \"Grounded\" by the band, but there's nothing of the bite from that song here.

He was surrounded by police officers in his family and neighborhood. The gun culture that exists now, though, is different from what he grew up with.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What I remember about guns is that I remember almost nothing about guns. People owned them; they didn’t talk about them. They didn’t cover their cars in bumper stickers about them, they didn’t fly flags about them, they didn’t pose for dumb pictures with them. (I’ll plead one personal exemption: When I was a little boy, relatives in Greece once posed me in a Greek Evzone-soldier costume with my uncle’s hunting shotgun. I could barely lift it.) Today, there is a neediness in the gun culture that speaks to deep insecurities among a certain kind of American citizen. The gun owners I knew—cops, veterans, hunters, sportsmen—owned guns as part of their life, sometimes as tools, sometimes for recreation. Gun ownership was not the central and defining feature of their life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He calls the culture now “performative insecurity,” and insists it’s no longer about rights. Given the performances that we see with guns these days, it’s hard to argue against that. Which brings up the question of how social media ties into the seeming need to show off firearms and whether it is exacerbating the problem. </p>\n\n<p>→ <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/06/problem-gun-culture-not-scotus/661375/\">The Problem Is Gun Culture, Not SCOTUS | The Atlantic</a></p>\n",

That’s time you could be spending pursuing structural changes to our society’s structural problems, or just relaxing with a book so you’ll have the energy to pursue those structural changes later. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the experience I’ve had even ordering online. I spend way more time and energy, for example, trying to get supplements from three different stores (while also paying more) than I would just ordering quickly from Amazon. I’ve got two big box hardware stores within five minutes, but I still sometimes have to get home improvement supplies from Amazon. </p>\n\n<p>You used to hear complaints from those at brick and mortar stores that customers were coming in to look at items in the store and then buy them on Amazon. Doctorow recommends turning the tables on Amazon with respect to this “show-rooming.” </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>For years, local merchants complained that their customers were “show-rooming” them: wandering their shelves to make sure the thing they were about to buy on Amazon suited their needs, then whipping out their phones and buying the goods on Amazon. I’m saying we should <em>turn Amazon into the showroom:</em> hijack its organization, reviews and recommendation algorithm to help us spend money locally. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He admits that there is a question of legality about his proposed solution, which would involve obfuscating part of Amazon’s core functionality. However, he reasons that the technique would be in keeping with Amazon’s own philosophy of disruption. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This won’t fix the Amazon problem, but it will fix <em>part</em> of the Amazon problem. <a href=\"https://www.isen.com/papers/Dawnstupid.html\">Turning monopolies into dumb pipe</a> is a time-honored tradition, the very soul of the gospel of disruption, which Amazon has preached since its earliest days.

It’s one thing to have a singular vision and change your tactics along the way; Williams vision for what Medium was transformed almost continuously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have twice been subscribed to Medium, but I couldn’t justify keeping my subscription because it didn’t make sense to get a yearly subscription to a service when you had no idea what the service would look like over the course of that year. The most recent time I subscribed, I paid because I liked publications on the platform — by the end of the year of my paid subscription — they were gone. Ev was unapologetic about the changes. Even last year, after nine years of turmoil, he suggested that more change was healthy and to be expected. </p>\n\n<p>Throughout all its changes, Medium kept betraying the trust of its partners.

When the piece was written, the Episcopalians were going through a conversation about changes to the book of prayer, primarily around gender recognition. </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the faintly tragic elements on display in the 1979 Prayer Book are the numerous borrowings from Orthodox liturgy, which reflect not just scholarly knowledge, but prayerful conversations with Russian and Greek scholars of the mid-20th century who were then genuine dialogue partners. It is hard to find such engagement with eastern Christianity in the Episcopal Church now, beyond the somewhat hollow testimony of facsimile icons in Church bookstores.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This puts me down a course of thought that recognizes that, no matter how positive the intent, changes to the fundamentals of Christian tradition put Christians in conflict. These changes become a barrier to ecumenism. They also leads to splits <em>within</em> churches, as some of the members will inevitably disagree with disruptions to tradition in which they are, presumably, deeply invested. </p>\n\n<p>Episcopalian Alan Jacobs, who linked to the article, was <a href=\"https://blog.ayjay.org/episcopalian-exclusionism/\">very concerned</a> about the revisions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>McGowan here identifies what I think is most worrisome about the current push for revision of the BCP: it is radically exclusionist. The Orthodox don’t matter, Catholics don’t matter, Anglicans outside of the U.S. don’t matter, non-revisionist Episcopalians don’t matter. Literally no one in the world matters except the revisionists themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I understand where he is coming from and I wish more churches would take these things into consideration.

The video was done in an intentionally kitschy old-school style of animation with the voice over imitation a 50’s instructional video. In the video, the congregation is in the church sanctuary, voting on a resolution that was disputed. Since the process was democratic, it should have solved the dispute and brought the congregation back in alignment. In reality, the video showed, the vote takes place and then the slightly less than half who lost the vote just leave to go to another church. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>The message of the video seemed so pessimistic. I had to wonder why we were showing the students this video. Maybe it was realistic, but how did it contribute to a positive view of church polity? What kid was going to be enthusiastic about participating in such a process? This question is important, because after being confirmed, the confirmands can then participate in church governance. </p>\n\n<p>It seems we are reinforcing the schismatic nature of the Protestant church in these sorts of lessons. If you don’t like the outcome of a disagreement with your church brothers and sisters, just pack up and leave. It’s a temptation that all of us face when difficulties arise, just to walk out and not look back. In his book, <em>You Are Not Your Own</em>, Alan Noble writes about how you shouldn’t leave your home church, “without much fear and trembling.” If everyone took that advice, we wouldn’t have thousands upon thousands of Protestant denominations. Unfortunately, that’s where we stand, the Christian Church more divided than any time in history, and <a href=\"https://www.americanpress.com/2022/07/03/a-church-divided-split-of-methodist-denomination-already-underway/\">on the path</a> to becoming <a href=\"https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2018/january/biggest-mennonite-conference-leaves-denomination.html\">still more divided</a>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought. (1 Corinthians 1:10)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>I want to experience a Christianity that doesn’t crack at every fault line.</em></p>\n",

Specifically, ANTI stands for:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Analog</li>\n<li>Numeric-alpha</li>\n<li>Tree</li>\n<li>Index</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Eleanor Koenig briefly mentions the concept in her latest <a href=\"https://www.obsidianroundup.org/2022-07-02/\">Obisidian Roundup newsletter</a>.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apparently some folks who use analog zettelkastens call them <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/antinet/\">antinets</a>. The subreddit community seems a bit dogmatic but I found skimming it to be interesting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I went to one YouTube video about the practice and the “tutorial” was very scattered. It spoke to me of a mind in disarray, even though there were so many index cards meant to portray order and information organization. After watching the video, the term “dogmatic” doesn’t surprise me. Despite the disorganization, there was a sense of superiority about the system and its powers of cognitive augmentation. </p>\n\n<p>I do kind of love the idea of a strictly <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/introduction-antinet-zettelkasten/\">analog zettelkasten</a>. When the system was developed, it was all analog.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-8172\" id=\"fnr1-8172\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> You would hardly know it, though, because the system is mostly mentioned in context with a tool like Obsidian. However, research has shown that retention is better when using pen and paper than when using digital tools. Scott Scheper is an influential proponent of the system.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Luhmann did not specify analog as a requirement over digital. The reason why is simple.

				"content_html": "<p>I have been thinking recently about trying out federated social media site Mastodon. I&rsquo;m interested in non-algorithmic microblogging and solutions that don&rsquo;t actively attempt to antagonize me. Cherie Baker recently joined Mastodon and has some good things to say about her experience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To my surprise, I like it! Mastodon + blog feels like a comfortable setup. In truth, shoehorning Twitter-like activity into a blog format always felt awkward to me. I’m not going to “live tweet” a movie on my blog, there are no silly gifs conversations here, and my blog has no good options for ephemerality other than lots of manual deletions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I can relate to it feeling awkward tweet-size posts into a main blog.

A lot has changed. Their workforce and market cap are massive. They are always plowing forward at breakneck speed now, sometimes at the expense of their users and their products.</p>\n<h2 id=\"screen-time\">Screen Time</h2>\n<p>The first thoughts I had following the Apple Worldwide Developer’s Conference Keynote this week centered around iPadOS 16. It’s ironic that Apple is now advertising <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-16-preview/\">new Parental Controls with iPadOS 16</a> when the existing ones don’t work. I have had a support ticket open with Apple going on nine months now about how the Downtime feature with Screen Time doesn’t function properly. I set limits on my son’s iPad gaming usage, and then frequently find him going over those limits just by noticing that he’s been playing games for a long time. When I check, the Screen Time limits have reset themselves to be disabled.</p>\n<p>I’ve set screen time limits for myself, and they generally last 2-3 days before resetting. Once I’ve realized things have reset, I have to go and turn the feature back on again, and specify all the exceptions. Then, a couple of days later, I have to do it over again. I have spent hours on the phone with Apple support troubleshooting, only for them to tell me it’s a known issue in development, and they just haven’t fixed it yet. My emails to follow-up are ignored. Each time I call — which I did again a couple of weeks ago — the support rep walks me through all sorts of troubleshooting that I’ve already done, then disappears for a while, and then comes back and tells me that they are aware of the issue and that others are reporting it. They still have no ETA on a fix. Six months ago, they told me a fix should be coming soon, and they would do something special for me and my son for our patience. They haven’t fixed the bug or done anything special for us.</p>\n<p>As someone who works in software development and spent ten years as a QA Manager, my advice for Apple would be to fix the breaking feature bugs before adding on to that same feature. It makes absolutely no sense to add anything to Screen Time or Parental Controls when the basic functionality doesn’t even work. This is a critical feature for me, as a parent. I need to be able to regulate my child’s screen time. Being able to control your child’s technology usage is not a nice-to-have, it’s an expectation these days. If the issue isn’t resolved, I will need to move my child to another platform where I can ensure he has appropriate limits. I’m starting to look at a Microsoft Surface tablet to replace his iPad. A tablet running Windows would give him the ability to run more games, anyway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"forced-obsolescence\">Forced Obsolescence</h2>\n<p>Another thing that I quickly realized regarding the announcement of iPadOS 16 was that I wouldn’t be able to run the signature feature, Stage Manager, on the iPad Air I bought new <strong>last year</strong>. That’s right, Apple products are obsolete after a single year. Had I known last year that I wouldn’t be able to run the multitasking features that were coming out in one year, I wouldn’t have purchased the iPad. Between the high-priced super Smart Keyboard and the tablet itself, the total was over a grand.</p>\n<p>As regular readers of my blog and newsletter will know, I’ve been dealing with disabling illness for the past couple of years and I can’t be spending a ton of money on computers that are out-of-date within a year. It would be fine if the iPad could serve as my only computer, but that functionality (being able to work effectively with an external screen) is a part of the Stage Manager feature. Therefore, I still have to maintain another desktop computer. If I want to be able to sync my software between the desktop computer and the tablet, those devices both have to be from Apple.</p>\n<p>When I told my boss about the fact that my almost-new iPad wouldn’t be getting the new features, he laughed at me and said that was typical for Apple. He cynically chalks it up to Apple trying to gin up more sales. Getting laughed at is something I’ve gotten used to as an Apple user over the last few years, but I’ve got to say, this time it stung because he’s right. This situation is ridiculous, and I feel like a sucker.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sticky-ecosystem\">Sticky Ecosystem</h2>\n<p>Apple has a very sticky ecosystem. Not only does buying more of <em>their</em> products ensure that your devices play together nicely, but they also have the healthiest independent developer community of any platform. For example, I can’t think of a single RSS reader on Windows.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> Nor can I think of a Markdown text editor that can post to a blogging engine. On the Mac there are many. As a power user, I’m not confident that you can even switch to Linux or Windows without giving up many capabilities provided by independent software. This is the situation, even though Apple, by many people’s estimates, does not treat their developers well.</p>\n<p>So as my frustration with Apple grows, I’m almost equally frustrated with companies like Microsoft for failing to make a platform as compelling as Apple’s for the personal computer developer and user. If one could do the same things on Windows that you can do on the Mac, it would provide Apple with more competition and a level of accountability from which their current hegemony in certain areas protects them.</p>\n<p>I doubt I will be switching away from Apple at this point, but I’m trying to think of ways to become less dependent on them for my computing, especially when it comes to my hobbies.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>I tried to help a colleague with finding an RSS reader for Windows or Linux recently and couldn’t think of anything. You can find articles about feed readers for Windows if you search, but those are mostly web-based and they actually have native Apple apps.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>For work, a Windows machine is fine.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>",

I need to be able to regulate my child’s screen time. Being able to control your child’s technology usage is not a nice-to-have, it’s an expectation these days. If the issue isn’t resolved, I will need to move my child to another platform where I can ensure he has appropriate limits. I’m starting to look at a Microsoft Surface tablet to replace his iPad. A tablet running Windows would give him the ability to run more games, anyway. \n\n## Forced Obsolescence \nAnother thing that I quickly realized regarding the announcement of iPadOS 16 was that I wouldn’t be able to run the signature feature, Stage Manager, on the iPad Air I bought new **last year**. That’s right, Apple products are obsolete after a single year. Had I known last year that I wouldn’t be able to run the multitasking features that were coming out in one year, I wouldn’t have purchased the iPad. Between the high-priced super Smart Keyboard and the tablet itself, the total was over a grand. \n\nAs regular readers of my blog and newsletter will know, I’ve been dealing with disabling illness for the past couple of years and I can’t be spending a ton of money on computers that are out-of-date within a year. It would be fine if the iPad could serve as my only computer, but that functionality (being able to work effectively with an external screen) is a part of the Stage Manager feature. Therefore, I still have to maintain another desktop computer. If I want to be able to sync my software between the desktop computer and the tablet, those devices both have to be from Apple. \n\nWhen I told my boss about the fact that my almost-new iPad wouldn’t be getting the new features, he laughed at me and said that was typical for Apple. He cynically chalks it up to Apple trying to gin up more sales. Getting laughed at is something I’ve gotten used to as an Apple user over the last few years, but I’ve got to say, this time it stung because he’s right. This situation is ridiculous, and I feel like a sucker. \n\n## Sticky Ecosystem\nApple has a very sticky ecosystem. Not only does buying more of _their_ products ensure that your devices play together nicely, but they also have the healthiest independent developer community of any platform. For example, I can’t think of a single RSS reader on Windows.[^1] Nor can I think of a Markdown text editor that can post to a blogging engine. On the Mac there are many. As a power user, I’m not confident that you can even switch to Linux or Windows without giving up many capabilities provided by independent software. This is the situation, even though Apple, by many people’s estimates, does not treat their developers well. \n\nSo as my frustration with Apple grows, I’m almost equally frustrated with companies like Microsoft for failing to make a platform as compelling as Apple’s for the personal computer developer and user. If one could do the same things on Windows that you can do on the Mac, it would provide Apple with more competition and a level of accountability from which their current hegemony in certain areas protects them. \n\nI doubt I will be switching away from Apple at this point, but I’m trying to think of ways to become less dependent on them for my computing, especially when it comes to my hobbies.[^2]\n\n\n[^1]:\tI tried to help a colleague with finding an RSS reader for Windows or Linux recently and couldn’t think of anything. You can find articles about feed readers for Windows if you search, but those are mostly web-based and they actually have native Apple apps. \n\n[^2]:\tFor work, a Windows machine is fine. \n",

				"title": "Reading It Later",
				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2022/d44062a129.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I have a Kobo Libra 2 ereader, and it’s one of my favorite devices. Of course, it is used for reading books, but I spend just as much time reading articles saved from the internet. I find I have a much greater capacity for reading long materials passed from the internet on an e-ink device. I’m using Pocket as my read-it-later service, and it syncs well with the Kobo. It’s a 2-way sync, so you can favorite and archive articles from the device.</p>\n<p>Other read-it-later services, such as Instapaper and Matter, have a 1-way push to the Kindle, but anything you do on the Kindle does not sync back to the service. While a 2-way sync is intrinsically superior to a 1-way sync, how the sync fits within your workflow determines how much more useful it is. In my case, I mainly use the 2-way Pocket sync on my Kobo to sync favorites back to the service, so I can go back to them on an iOS device and make highlights from there — something you cannot do on the Kobo. Readwise (I’m on a free trial of that service) syncs the highlighted passages and other metadata from Pocket to Obsidian. I pull article information from Obsidian into Ulysses to write about it. I’m doing that part manually. I don’t yet have it automated, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqTyyQBi3hA\">like Matt Bircher</a>.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"highlights\">Highlights</h2>\n<p>Although my workflow is okay, it’s a bit more manual than I would like. It would be much easier, for example, if I could highlight article passages on my Kobo and have them automatically sync to Obsidian, as I can do with books. Since I have to go back to my iOS devices to create highlights, the 2-way sync is of somewhat limited usefulness, in my case. It is hardly superior to the 1-way push from Instapaper or Matter to the Kindle, where I have to go back to my iOS device for article management, anyway.</p>\n<p>Where Instapaper and Matter end up being superior to Pocket is in the management of highlights. Through a third party service like Readwise — that has a non-trivial monthly subscription fee — Pocket has decent highlights management. On its own, extracting highlights from the service is difficult. From the web interface, you can only copy a link to the article from the highlight. Inexplicably, there is no way to pull out highlights without going through a standard copy and paste, which makes the usefulness of highlights themselves low. On iOS, you can extract the highlights through the share button, but not many programs can accept the output and most only show a link to the article. Ulysses, for instance, only occasionally captures the quote. I would love to see the folks behind Pocket come up with better options for highlight export. Perhaps even an image you can share on your blog or social media, like many other services, such as Glasp or Matter, would be nice.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I have low confidence in the ongoing development of Pocket. The “what’s new” section of their web app has not been updated for almost a year. Their parent company, Moz://a, is consistently in financial trouble. Theoretically, Pocket as a revenue stream should help, but their pay tier offerings have very little value add. I’m at a loss for what $5 a month gets you over the free tier, except more than 3 highlights per article, additional fonts and tag suggestions. I find 3 highlights per article to be plenty for most pieces, I’m fine with the Graphik font, and I can create my own tag taxonomy. One of the tags I use is an @[name] tag to remember where I found the link, so I can provide proper attribution if I write about the piece on my blog. I doubt Pocket is going to suggest tags that would fit in such a custom system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"matter\">Matter</h2>\n<p>In contrast to the slow pace of Pocket development, Matter has been aggressively improving their app. They just launched version 2.0, in what, I believe, is less than a year after the original 1.0 release. Version numbers don’t necessarily convey the pace of change, but in this case, the application was redesigned for the second release. The first version of the app was frequently criticized for being too cluttered. <a href=\"https://hq.getmatter.com/nucleus\">Matter 2.0</a> removed the social experience, which is better left up to dedicated social media platforms, and received a largely positive response from users.</p>\n<p>Matter is based on the premise that the modern reading economy is being  constructed by individual writers rather than aggregates of writers brought together by publications. So, it builds in what is essentially an RSS reader for blogs and newsletters, based around writers. The creators are betting that the kind of app will become increasingly necessary in a fragmented reading environment.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Still, we can predict a few things with confidence: The supply of great content will continue to rise (and nichify), attention will always be scarce, and the returns to making good decisions about what to read will remain high — and indeed, increase — over time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The paradigm seems to work fairly well, with the writers you would expect being recognized by the system and made easy to follow and more writers being added all the time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ereaders\">Ereaders</h2>\n<p>Coming back to the reading experience on an ereader, Matter lets you <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/94ef8b6ba6d443a4a373690d51d987bb\">push articles individually to Kindle</a>. The feature assumes that you don’t want to automatically sync <em>all</em> of your saved articles to your ereader. It also assumes that you don’t necessarily want to send all the articles in your <em>inbox</em> to your ereader (like Instapaper does). While the Pocket/Kobo integration is smart enough not to send things like videos or articles that can’t be parsed to the Kobo, you still get everything else, which can be a plus or minus, depending on your workflow.</p>\n<p>I might be ready to dive further into the Matter ecosystem as a forward-looking alternative to Pocket, but am I prepared to get back into the world of Amazon reading with the Kindle? Despite <a href=\"https://frostedechoes.com/2021/08/10/conscientious-consumerism-and.html\">my strong feelings toward Amazon</a>, I’m considering it. I’m glad I’ve got an old Kindle to try a new process on, so I don’t have to jump in without seeing what this looks like.</p>",

I find I have a much greater capacity for reading long materials passed from the internet on an e-ink device. I’m using Pocket as my read-it-later service, and it syncs well with the Kobo. It’s a 2-way sync, so you can favorite and archive articles from the device. \n\n<!--more-->\n\nOther read-it-later services, such as Instapaper and Matter, have a 1-way push to the Kindle, but anything you do on the Kindle does not sync back to the service. While a 2-way sync is intrinsically superior to a 1-way sync, how the sync fits within your workflow determines how much more useful it is. In my case, I mainly use the 2-way Pocket sync on my Kobo to sync favorites back to the service, so I can go back to them on an iOS device and make highlights from there — something you cannot do on the Kobo. Readwise (I’m on a free trial of that service) syncs the highlighted passages and other metadata from Pocket to Obsidian. I pull article information from Obsidian into Ulysses to write about it. I’m doing that part manually. I don’t yet have it automated, [like Matt Bircher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqTyyQBi3hA). \n\n<img src=\"https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2022/041dfa1708.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"\" />\n\n## Highlights\nAlthough my workflow is okay, it’s a bit more manual than I would like. It would be much easier, for example, if I could highlight article passages on my Kobo and have them automatically sync to Obsidian, as I can do with books. Since I have to go back to my iOS devices to create highlights, the 2-way sync is of somewhat limited usefulness, in my case. It is hardly superior to the 1-way push from Instapaper or Matter to the Kindle, where I have to go back to my iOS device for article management, anyway.\n\nWhere Instapaper and Matter end up being superior to Pocket is in the management of highlights. Through a third party service like Readwise — that has a non-trivial monthly subscription fee — Pocket has decent highlights management. On its own, extracting highlights from the service is difficult. From the web interface, you can only copy a link to the article from the highlight. Inexplicably, there is no way to pull out highlights without going through a standard copy and paste, which makes the usefulness of highlights themselves low. On iOS, you can extract the highlights through the share button, but not many programs can accept the output and most only show a link to the article. Ulysses, for instance, only occasionally captures the quote. I would love to see the folks behind Pocket come up with better options for highlight export. Perhaps even an image you can share on your blog or social media, like many other services, such as Glasp or Matter, would be nice.\n\nUnfortunately, I have low confidence in the ongoing development of Pocket. The “what’s new” section of their web app has not been updated for almost a year. Their parent company, Moz://a, is consistently in financial trouble. Theoretically, Pocket as a revenue stream should help, but their pay tier offerings have very little value add. I’m at a loss for what $5 a month gets you over the free tier, except more than 3 highlights per article, additional fonts and tag suggestions. I find 3 highlights per article to be plenty for most pieces, I’m fine with the Graphik font, and I can create my own tag taxonomy. One of the tags I use is an @[name] tag to remember where I found the link, so I can provide proper attribution if I write about the piece on my blog. I doubt Pocket is going to suggest tags that would fit in such a custom system. \n\n## Matter \nIn contrast to the slow pace of Pocket development, Matter has been aggressively improving their app. They just launched version 2.0, in what, I believe, is less than a year after the original 1.0 release. Version numbers don’t necessarily convey the pace of change, but in this case, the application was redesigned for the second release. The first version of the app was frequently criticized for being too cluttered. [Matter 2.0](https://hq.getmatter.com/nucleus) removed the social experience, which is better left up to dedicated social media platforms, and received a largely positive response from users. \n\nMatter is based on the premise that the modern reading economy is being  constructed by individual writers rather than aggregates of writers brought together by publications. So, it builds in what is essentially an RSS reader for blogs and newsletters, based around writers. The creators are betting that the kind of app will become increasingly necessary in a fragmented reading environment. \n\n> Still, we can predict a few things with confidence: The supply of great content will continue to rise (and nichify), attention will always be scarce, and the returns to making good decisions about what to read will remain high — and indeed, increase — over time.\n\nThe paradigm seems to work fairly well, with the writers you would expect being recognized by the system and made easy to follow and more writers being added all the time. \n\n## Ereaders\nComing back to the reading experience on an ereader, Matter lets you [push articles individually to Kindle](https://www.loom.com/share/94ef8b6ba6d443a4a373690d51d987bb). The feature assumes that you don’t want to automatically sync *all* of your saved articles to your ereader. It also assumes that you don’t necessarily want to send all the articles in your _inbox_ to your ereader (like Instapaper does). While the Pocket/Kobo integration is smart enough not to send things like videos or articles that can’t be parsed to the Kobo, you still get everything else, which can be a plus or minus, depending on your workflow. \n\nI might be ready to dive further into the Matter ecosystem as a forward-looking alternative to Pocket, but am I prepared to get back into the world of Amazon reading with the Kindle? Despite [my strong feelings toward Amazon](https://frostedechoes.com/2021/08/10/conscientious-consumerism-and.html), I’m considering it. I’m glad I’ve got an old Kindle to try a new process on, so I don’t have to jump in without seeing what this looks like.  \n\n",

They are useful for organizing our thoughts; they become extremely dangerous when we mistake them for reality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Who would have thought that acknowledging motherhood could be dangerous? Eventually, in the world that Schillace envisions, it would be a case of life imitating art: Humans would be as disgusted at the natural course of childbirth and rearing as the characters that populate Huxley’s novel. </p>\n\n<p>When I brought this article up to my mom, she thought it was best not to spend too much time worrying about what fringe thinkers postulate. I'm not so sure, though. Modifying the fundamental building block of humanity — reproduction — could have dire consequences.

If you are paying attention to social media, that will be a grim and unsettling world.</li>\n<li>You’ll have more privacy.

The band that released the album, the Buggles, captured the spirit of the age by announcing “Video Killed The Radio Star” in a nod to the rise of MTV (Music Television). They had their fingers on the pulse of the American music scene that was springing up in the wake of disco and the long tail of the rise of punk. Plastic was an appropriate metaphor for an embrace of everything synthetic. Synthesizers captured the popular imagination and even stole some thunder from the guitar. </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>The <em>Covers</em> EP from Mint Julep features mostly reworkings of 80s tunes. There’s a startling principle at work here, though — that these tunes from the age of plastic simply didn’t have enough synths. Even the cover of aughts-era band Headphones “I Never Wanted You” layers more warbly synths than the original, and that band was created specifically as a synthesizer-based side project! </p>\n\n<p>Though these were recorded a decade ago, the songs on the EP tread familiar territory with Angel Olsen's covers from her <em>Aisles</em> EP. Many of the tracks have slower tempos than that originals and walls of synths that are so dense as to be almost impenetrable. Whether a song is from Depeche Mode or When in Rome, Mint Julep bends the track to sound like it’s theirs, making this EP a cohesive listening experience.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Almost a year ago, Wordpress owner Automattic bought the beloved journaling app, Day One. One of the first things that was announced was imminent integration with Automattic's two blogging tools, Wordpress and Tumblr. This news wasn't shocking, as Day One previously had integrated with Tumblr and being able to share a journal entry publicly on established blogging platforms made sense. Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg even called journaling in Day One \"private blogging.\"</p>\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2021/06/14/day-one-the-journaling-app-joins-automattic/\">a post on The official Wordpress.com blog</a> that came with the acquisition announcement, Eli Budelli laid out the integrations planned for Day One. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That doesn’t mean that everything you journal has to stay private, though. When you want to share specific entries – or even entire journals with the world – you can expect seamless integrations with both WordPress.com and Tumblr to do just that. On the flip side of that, importing your favorite content from WordPress.com and Tumblr into Day One is on the near-term roadmap. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not only would you be able to share from Day One, but you would, shortly thereafter — in the near term — be able to absorb your blog posts into your digital journal. It sounded like a journaler and blogger's dream to have one app to capture both public and private thoughts. Unfortunately, as dreams do, it seems to have vanished with the light of day. Since joining Automattic, Day One development feels like it has slowed quite a bit. They haven't updated their blog so far this year and the app updates are mostly bug fixes.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-22779\" id=\"fnr1-22779\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>I assume, since the ability to share posts publicly has not been forthcoming, the ability to bring blog posts into your journal is pretty far off. Even Micro.blog has a great Day One import option, but Automattic doesn't have such a feature for its own blogging tools.<sup><a href=\"#fn2-22779\" id=\"fnr2-22779\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> </p>\n\n<p>Seeing how Tumblr has been managed since the earlier acquisition by Automattic, I suppose none of this should be too surprising. Tumblr seems to have fared about as well under the disinterest of former owners, Verizon, as it has under a company that theoretically cares about blogging. Of course, given that Wordpress has taken a decidedly sharp turn away from blogging and towards more commercial interests, maybe you can no longer assume that Automattic really cares about blogging, either. </p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-22779\">\n<p>Though they did add a rainbow app icon option — how contemporary! <a href=\"#fnr1-22779\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-22779\">\n<p>This may be more of a testament to Micro.blog developer Manton Reece's dedication to improving his platform more than anything else. <a href=\"#fnr2-22779\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

The phenomenon is detailed by Odette Yousef in the NPR piece <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/05/10/1096741988/orthodox-christian-churches-are-drawing-in-far-right-american-converts\">Orthodox Christian churches are drawing in far-right American converts</a>. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Those who have followed the influx of extremists into American Orthodoxy agree that those individuals are fringe within the church and are mostly concentrated in newly founded ROCOR parishes. But they also warn that it would be foolish to ignore them. Of particular concern are the ways in which these individuals are networking with outside extremist groups and broadcasting their ideologies in the name of Orthodoxy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have to wonder to what extent Christians are leaving mainline or evangelical churches for Orthodox Christianity overall. The traditional American churches have changed in substantial ways to align with contemporary American cultural values. The piece on the book points out what a small minority the extremists represent within the Orthodox Church several times. However, it doesn't get at the number of people who are making the conversion to orthodoxy, but who couldn't be painted with that brush. I suppose that wouldn't help with the narrative that is being spun here. </p>\n\n<p>After the last service I attended at a Greek Orthodox Church, I asked a member of the clergy if he could tell me one thing that has changed in the last fifty years. At first, he struggled and couldn't come up with an answer. Then, you could see the light bulb flicker on in his head. Some lines in one of the hymns in their hymnal had changed in the recent past, he told me, beaming with pride. That was all he could come up with, and he was clearly satisfied. There's a path of continuity in the Orthodox tradition. Even Catholicism, that ancient faith which traces the first Bishop of Rome back to Peter, the rock on which Jesus said He would build his church, doesn’t match the allegiance to tradition that is present in Orthodox Christianity. </p>\n\n<p>It makes some sense then, as we watch other churches argue about traditional versus contemporary services, or whether worship should be changed to incorporate more gender-neutral language, that a certain segment of Christians would be attracted to the stability of orthodoxy. The Reformers once accused the Catholics of innovation, but it’s now mostly protestant churches that change elements of belief and worship. From the perspective of this believer, the changes are sometimes helpful and sometimes not. “Ecclesia reformata, semper reformanda,” is the rallying cry, but when do the reforms go too far?<sup><a href=\"#fn1-15565\" id=\"fnr1-15565\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> It can seem like, each time a substantial change is made, a schism — seen or unseen — takes place in its wake and a new church is born. The process reminds me of dubbing cassette tapes as a kid. Whenever a copy of a copy was made, there was a palpable loss of fidelity. A little more noise to go with the signal. </p>\n\n<p>As I witness this happening, I'm reminded of a story that has haunted me since I read it. <a href=\"https://medium.com/adams-notebook/the-green-eyed-christ-fb98e3196828\">The Green-Eyed Christ</a> by Adam Roberts is a cautionary metaphorical tale of church splits and new doctrines. The story takes place in the fourteenth century (pre-reformation) and follows a painter, Mijnheer Jacco Heuschrecke. Heuschrecke unknowingly gains a power by which anything he paints will be created in Heaven. As is the custom of the time, he paints mainly religious works and soon there are 12 new Christs in Heaven, all trying to decide who is the real deal. When the painter runs out of blue paint, he paints a Green-Eyed Christ, who, being the 13th and by virtue of his difference from the others, claims to be the true Christ. He comes to visit the confused painter to tell him only to sketch fourteen representations of God — that an angel has told Heuschrecke to fully paint — and give them colored eyes. Heuschrecke is troubled by sketching more beings in Heaven to add to the confusion. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘They are already in Heaven,’ said the Green-Eyed Christ. ‘But weakly: like spectres, potentless, wandering here and there. A dab of paint will give them more substantiality in the eternal realm, but not so much as to be able to reassert the old, stifling order. And from this point the grace of God will pour down upon the world in a new way — in ten thousand variants, in new religions and new sciences, in a great flourescence of culture and life and possibility.’</p>\n\n<p>‘Will it be so?’ Heuschrecke asked. His initial shock, at having an intimate conversation with the saviour of all humanity, had settled, and now he found himself uncertain as to the merits of what this Green-Eyed Christ was saying. ‘Must it be so?’</p>\n\n<p>‘It is a new dawn, my friend,’ said the Green-Eyed Christ.</p>\n\n<p>‘But what of Holy Mother Church?’</p>\n\n<p>‘She will persist.’</p>\n\n<p>‘But broken — fractured?</p>\n\n<p>‘Oh yes. Broken as white light is broken into the rainbow.’</p>\n\n<p>‘Heresies will prosper, like rank weeds in a beautiful flowerbed? No, Lord, surely not! Rival churches will challenge the oneness of faith?’</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The painter flees, vowing to finish the paintings of God and, therefore, bring balance back to Heaven. It is hinted that Heuschrecke never finishes his paintings, <em>but we already know how the story ends.</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-15565\">\n<p>Ecclesia reformata, semper reformanda: The church reformed, always reforming. <a href=\"#fnr1-15565\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

I typically write a lot of link posts because I read quite a bit online and want to share things that I think are interesting. This comes from a desire to add my thoughts to what is put out there by others, and — let’s face it — comment sections are a pretty bad way to do it. Lately, though, a lot of what I see online has to do with the outrage of the week. “Outrage of the week” sounds like some cute embellishment, but it has become literally accurate. Every week, the people on the internet collectively lose their minds about a particular subject. Then, everyone gives a hot take on that subject. When the next week hits, there’s a new subject to write about. It has become an all-too-familiar standard pattern.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying that these subjects aren’t truly outrageous (the war in Ukraine being a particularly potent example). With so many people writing about the same thing, though, adding another voice to the chorus doesn’t always feel appropriate or effective. Former religion advisor to President Obama, Micheal Wear, recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelrwear/status/1523390036867125248?s=21&amp;t=oRJAm-Yq1XzZAERwwEip7g\">tweeted about this</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2022/41da6f0011.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I want to continue to <strong>read</strong> about these issues, I’m just not sure that I wish to write about them. Even in the vastness of the World Wide Web, escaping “the outrage” and reading and writing about something different can be difficult. So, I’m going to slow down on link posting in the way that I have been doing it. I’ll still be blogging. I just don’t want to commit to a weekly email, in case, on any given week, I just can’t find enough that I want to write about. At least not enough to write about without getting sucked into the outrage.</p>\n<p>Luke Harrington writes about how the outrage of the week <a href=\"https://luketharrington.substack.com/p/i-took-a-break-from-social-media\">drove him off social media</a>. He understood that there were good people on either side of the issue.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I knew, though, that social media would not show me evidence of this.

That panicky, breathless misinformation would spread like chlamydia, and the most ignorant, unthinking voices would be amplified to deafening levels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A news story, told by a mob of idiots, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to write about what&rsquo;s going on in the world when social media is bringing us down to the lowest common denominator.

Is the validation I get from the site healthy? Is having to be active on social media healthy? Is having to read the horrible news every day healthy? What else could I be doing here? What could I be doing somewhere else? What good is a blog without a thriving community of other blogs? I’ve tried thinking about these and many other questions while continuing my work here, but I haven’t made much progress; I need time away to gain perspective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It will be interesting to see if Jason comes back, or if he decides that having to follow what is going on around the internet is too mentally taxing and not worth the effort and the return.</p>\n<p>Similarly, I won&rsquo;t be doing &ldquo;Week on the Web&rdquo; digests for the foreseeable future.

Not to imply that this will be a tectonic shift in the tech landscape, but there are so many people signing up that the community manager, Jean MacDonald, has not been able to [keep up with her usual personal welcome](https://micro.welltempered.net/2022/04/27/what-an-extraordinary.html) to the newcomers. \n\n<!--more-->\n\nAlready, people are seeing the vibe shift, moving from the contentious confines of Twitter to the smaller federated blogging service. \n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" data-title=\"\" data-author=\"Harry Marks\" data-avatar=\"https://micro.blog/hcmarks/avatar.jpg\" cite=\"https://www.hcmarks.com/2022/04/27/i-must-say.html\"><p>I must say, there is a general feeling of positivity on this site not felt or seen on that <em>other</em> site.

You’re there to post interesting things and/or chat with people. Nothing else makes sense.\n\nThat about sums it up. \n\nI’m not confident that we’ll all of a sudden see huge amounts of users or major celebrities showing up on Micro.blog. DHH [is comparing those quitting Twitter](https://world.hey.com/dhh/rogan-popped-the-cancel-balloon-d6bba875) to the people who promoted boycotting Spotify over Joe Rogan. After the boycott, [Spotify only added users](https://gizmodo.com/so-much-for-delete-spotify-1848847396). I want to say that this time is different, but the public is fickle. I’m not certain how strong the objection to Musk actually is, even in the face of the [terrible things he is already doing](https://www.platformer.news/p/musk-flips-twitter-the-bird) regarding the company.\n\n> And it’s not just executives: roughly a dozen Twitter employees have been doxxed by trolls in the past few days, I’m told. Sometimes it’s because they were responding to one of Musk’s tweets; other times it has been as simple as employees tweeting that they’re looking for new jobs.\n\nMusk is clearly a malevolent force in the marketplace of ideas, but is his mismanagement and vitriol enough to cause a sustained rush for the exit? Only time will tell. \n\n\n",

This particular survey is based on principles from <a href=\"https://zengerfolkman.com/\">Zenger Folkman</a>. The purpose of this survey is to help you identify your strengths and become even stronger in those areas. The assessment seeks to answer the question of what differentiates you as a leader. The premise is that you can’t make a leader great by taking an area where they are weak and making them a bit stronger in that area so that they become potentially average. However, if you can take something they are already good out and make them great at it, you can augment the skills of someone who can actually influence others.</p>\n<p>When I took the survey, my strongest areas were honesty and integrity. We decided to hone in on those areas for my leadership development activities. Given the identification of strength in those areas and a commitment toward further development of honesty and integrity, I am sensitive to distrust. There are all sorts of ways people can express distrust these days. I wrote <a href=\"https://frostedechoes.com/2021/10/27/tcd-total-cost.html\">a post describing a few of the ways</a> I have felt distrusted in the past. Distrust can involve individual or group dynamics. It can be the result of previous negative experiences that have conditioned someone to be doubtful of either other’s intentions or their presentation of truth, as I outlined in the piece. However, there can also be ex ante distrust built up by the media we consume that tells us to look askance at anyone with views outside our adopted tribe. These can come from being in an epistemic bubble or an echo chamber.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-echo-chamber\">The echo chamber</h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-its-as-hard-to-escape-an-echo-chamber-as-it-is-to-flee-a-cult\">a piece for Aeon magazine</a>, C Thi Nguyen describes an “epistemic bubble” and an “echo chamber.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An ‘epistemic bubble’ is an informational network from which relevant voices have been excluded by omission. That omission might be purposeful: we might be selectively avoiding contact with contrary views because, say, they make us uncomfortable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a crucial distinction between the two.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An ‘echo chamber’ is a social structure from which other relevant voices have been actively discredited. Where an epistemic bubble merely omits contrary views, an echo chamber brings its members to actively distrust outsiders.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When even friends or family members impugn your honesty, despite all evidence that you are a credible source of information, you can infer that perhaps they are living in an echo chamber.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here’s a basic check: does a community’s belief system actively undermine the trustworthiness of any outsiders who don’t subscribe to its central dogmas? Then it’s probably an echo chamber.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hesitate to use the phrase “drinking the Kool-Aid” because of its dark origins, but it’s a colloquialism that everyone in English-speaking Western culture understands. People inside these echo chambers form their opinions before all the available evidence is present, based on what their media has fed them, and then, post hoc, come up with arguments on which to base their positions. Intuition drives the emotion, and the rational mind follows. They are fed by outlets like Twitter, which serve to amplify confirmation bias and algorithmically create and sustain echo chambers.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Haidt (whose book I just finished), starts <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369\">his latest piece for the Atlantic</a> by invoking the biblical story of the Tower of Babel. The story comes from the first book of the Bible, <em>Genesis</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The scattering of the people who built the tower and the confusion of their language so that they could no longer communicate has striking parallels to modern America. Haidt makes the connection for us.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But Babel is not a story about tribalism; it’s a story about the fragmentation of everything. It’s about the shattering of all that had seemed solid, the scattering of people who had been a community. It’s a metaphor for what is happening not only <em>between</em> red and blue, but within the left and within the right, as well as within universities, companies, professional associations, museums, and even families.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to detail the ways in which our society has broken down and fractured, hastened by the rise of social media. The piece dives into viral dynamics. It explains how tweaks such as the Facebook like and, more powerfully, the Twitter retweet, served to germinate online mobs and the behavior that accompanies mob mentality. Haidt calls this a stupefaction process, indicating that it inhibits clear thinking. As the quote above states, this doesn’t just happen between an “in group” and an “out group,” it happens within groups (both on the left and the right).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can see the stupefaction process most clearly when a person on the left merely points to research that questions or contradicts a favored belief among progressive activists. Someone on Twitter will find a way to associate the dissenter with racism, and others will pile on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’ve seen this play out in real life, even when the topic of discussion has nothing to do with race, and it’s not pretty. Ideas and people are shut down, cursed by an epithet with which almost no one wants to associate. The term “demonize” becomes appropriate, and its etymology tells us all we need to know about the severity of that characterization.</p>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t talk a lot about actual demons, these days. However, Alan Jacobs <a href=\"https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/something-happened-by-us-a-demonology\">writes about being absorbed into the demonic realm</a> by powers beyond our control. The ability to escape this realm starts with recognition.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now, as it happens, I am myself a Christian, but I do not write here to issue an altar call, an invitation to be saved by Jesus. Rather, I merely wish you, dear reader, to consider the possibility that when a tweet provokes you to wrath, or an Instagram post makes you envious, or some online article sends you to another and yet another in an endless chain of what St. Augustine called curiositas — his favorite example is the gravitational pull on all passers-by of a dead body on the side of the road — you are dealing with powers greater than yours. Your small self and your puny will are overwhelmed by the Cosmic Rulers, the Principalities and Powers. They oppress or possess you, and they can neither be deflected nor, by the mere exercise of will, overcome. Any freedom from what torments us begins with a proper demonology. Later we may proceed to exorcism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once we recognize how these urges toward animosity are creeping over us, we can begin to act. In the case of social media, action may mean reworking your method of engagement. You could refine the list of people you follow. You might realize abstinence is the only way you can properly shape your experience. Whatever may bring down the temperature and ill will towards others is advisable.

No one is an island, merely buffered against the waves that others make in the ocean. We are, in fact, connected with others in a way that protects us against the tempests that rage and threaten to destroy. John Donne was an English writer and cleric, but his metaphor works well with the composition of the United States. In the continent that Donne uses as an illustration, we are states that are federalized, all claiming our own identities, but coming together in overarching principles and common goals. We share topology and natural features like rivers and mountains that span across the lines that divide us one from another.</p>\n<p>I would write that, unless you are living alone in the woods, your connections matter. However, even Thoreau, who staked his claim alone beside Walden Pond, went back to civilization to work and have his mom do his laundry. We need our neighbors and the connections we have to each other. Our species cannot survive without functional reciprocity and mutual growth. It&rsquo;s past time we started being more careful about how we engage in the activities that undermine relationships. Let&rsquo;s set new standards for ourselves and our conduct, knowing that together we can benefit each other. Rather than contracting, and sealing ourselves in our chambers, we can expand one another, broadening our horizons.</p>\n<p>📷 Image source: <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/8X9rjt\">Brandon Burke on Flickr</a></p>",

We share topology and natural features like rivers and mountains that span across the lines that divide us one from another. \n\nI would write that, unless you are living alone in the woods, your connections matter. However, even Thoreau, who staked his claim alone beside Walden Pond, went back to civilization to work and have his mom do his laundry. We need our neighbors and the connections we have to each other. Our species cannot survive without functional reciprocity and mutual growth. It's past time we started being more careful about how we engage in the activities that undermine relationships. Let's set new standards for ourselves and our conduct, knowing that together we can benefit each other. Rather than contracting, and sealing ourselves in our chambers, we can expand one another, broadening our horizons. \n\n📷 Image source: [Brandon Burke on Flickr](https://flic.kr/p/8X9rjt) \n\n",

The statistics he cites are alarming. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>U.S. growth didn’t slowly fade away: It slipped, and slipped, and then fell off a cliff. The 2010s were already demographically stagnant; every year from 2011 to 2017, the U.S. grew by only 2 million people. In 2020, the U.S. grew by just 1.1 million. Last year, we added only 393,000 people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I know that there are some people who won't see this as a bad thing. After all, population growth leads to competition for resources and overpopulation. The humans who exist now can't all get access to appropriate resources. People still freeze to death outside of homes that could keep them warm. Unfortunates starve while others eat until they are stuffed. Equality seems further and further away in many places. </p>\n\n<p>So why do we need more people in the world and specifically in the countries in Europe and Japan and the US, where birth rates are declining and population growth through immigration is sometimes viewed with suspicion? Thompson is careful to state that he thinks that ultimately, family planning is a matter for individuals to decide, even as the macro-level consequences may be economically devastating. He doesn't shy away from elaborating on those consequences, though. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The implications of permanently slumped population growth are wide-ranging. Shrinking populations produce stagnant economies. Stagnant economies create wonky cultural knock-on effects, like a zero-sum mentality that ironically makes it harder to pursue pro-growth policies. (For example, people in slow-growth regions might be fearful of immigrants because they seem to represent a threat to scarce business opportunities, even though immigration represents these places’ best chance to grow their population and economy.) The sector-by-sector implications of declining population would also get very wonky very fast. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He sees this course we are on as leading us into a \"demographic danger zone.\" In <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-14/humans-having-fewer-babies-is-a-big-economic-problem-quicktake\">another piece that summarizes the problem</a>, potential causes and predicted outcomes, Scott Lanman lays out the challenges that Japan is experiencing due to their extremely low population growth.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Japan, employers often <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/quicktake/japan-s-shrinking-population\">struggle</a> to fill job vacancies. Spending on health care and pensions has swollen Japan’s public debt to more than twice the size of its economy. The International Monetary Fund has estimated that the country’s annual economic growth could be 1 percentage point lower for the next three decades because of Japan’s aging population. That means the country’s economy, forecast to expand 1 percent this year and next, may stagnate further.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To mix metaphors, Japan is the canary in the coal mine for other nations who are heading down this road. It's a scary prospect when the younger population cannot produce enough to support programs that take care of the elderly. Thompson mentions the situation pitting the younger generation against the older generation in his post and let us hope it doesn't come to that. </p>\n\n<img src=\"https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2022/53890da9e2.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"253\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2>The religion connection</h2>\n\n<p>One surprising thing that both pieces have in common is that they both ignore the correlation between religiosity and fertility. Though not completely universal, in the majority of cases, fertility declines along with religiosity. Expectations of gender roles plays a part here, with more conservative religious expressions tending to have the greatest fertility. A <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19672317/\">study of the relationship between the two factors in 2002</a> takes the data that shows the correlation and examines causation. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Using data from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), we show that women who report that religion is \"very important\" in their everyday life have both higher fertility and higher intended fertility than those saying religion is \"somewhat important\" or \"not important.\" Factors such as unwanted fertility, age at childbearing, or degree of fertility postponement seem not to contribute to religiosity differentials in fertility. This answer prompts more fundamental questions: what is the nature of this greater \"religiosity\"? And why do the more religious want more children? We show that those saying religion is more important have more traditional gender and family attitudes and that these attitudinal differences account for a substantial part of the fertility differential. We speculate regarding other contributing causes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With traditional attitudes about gender declining along with religiosity, we should probably be worried about the trend. Those who would either celebrate the rise of secularism or at the very least shrug their shoulders should be informed about the overall results of the shift. Demographic changes brought about by attitudinal and lifestyle changes are poised to have destructive consequences. While Thompson may very well be correct that the choices about reproduction should be up to individuals, the aggregate of those decisions will effect everyone. </p>\n\n<p>In his book, <em>The Righteous Mind</em>, Jonathan Haidt examines the group cohesion brought by religion, and the loosening of those ties and ends up in the same place as Thompson and Lanman. Haidt is another secular writer who sees the trend of lower birth rates, but brings different attributional causes to the table. He looks at increasingly irreligious Europe as a cautionary tale. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Societies that forgo the exoskeleton of religion should reflect carefully on what will happen to them over several generations. We don’t really know, because the first atheistic societies have only emerged in Europe in the last few decades. They are the least efficient societies ever known at turning resources (of which they have a lot) into offspring (of which they have few).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Haidt doesn’t lay out the outcome of fewer offspring, but it would be surprising if he anticipated anything other than what is predicted by others and reported by Thompson and Lanman. Haidt does get into more specifics about what happens in general when group cohesion dissolves in the absence of religion. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But if you are an atheist living in a looser community with a less binding moral matrix, you might have to rely somewhat more on an internal moral compass, read by the rider.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-22274\" id=\"fnr1-22274\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> That might sound appealing to rationalists, but it is also a recipe for anomie—Durkheim’s word for what happens to a society that no longer has a shared moral order.(It means, literally, “normlessness.”) We evolved to live, trade and trust within shared moral matrices. When societies lose their grip on individuals, allowing all to do as they please, the result is often a decrease in happiness and an increase in suicide, as Durkheim showed more than a hundred years ago.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does that sound familiar? You don’t have to look far to find statistics and analysis about a growing mental health crisis and rise in suicide in the United States. What you don’t typically see examined is what Emile Durkheim (considered the founder of sociology) observed around the turn of the 20th century, namely that dissolving group cohesion along with the ties of religious affiliations correlate directly to the negative mental health outcomes to which we are now bearing witness. </p>\n\n<p>The mainstream media, being mostly secular, tends to avoid the potential causality of these problems being the weakening institutions of religion. However, there is plenty of evidence which which to make the case that there is a relatively linear relationship between this phenomenon and a number of troubling societal trends. </p>\n\n<p>📷 Image source: Amir Arabshahi <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/ERSKz8OrZIQ\">on Unsplash</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-22274\">\n<p>Haidt uses the metaphor of the elephant and the rider to describe our intuitive and rational selves, respectively.  <a href=\"#fnr1-22274\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

His point was that if you are a blogger, you are a writer. A writer for those who read your content online. It was an inspirational talk in how it shifted the way you can think about your writing and your readers. A little change in perspective can go a long way when you are trying to motivate yourself to put pen to paper, or fingers to keyboard, in this case. </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>One of the things I’ve noticed when writing online is that people read very differently and prefer to get their content across different mediums. Even within my family, my writing is more likely to be read by certain individuals if it is presented in a way that they prefer. For instance:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>My mom is most likely to read something if she sees a link on Twitter. Less so if the content is delivered via email, partially because her inbox is out-of-control.</li>\n<li>My sister is more likely to read what I’ve written if it comes through email. She is not on very many social media platforms, and won’t see anything I’ve posted to Twitter.</li>\n<li>My wife is more likely to read an email, as well. She is heavily on Twitter, and follows a lot of people, so sometimes my posts get lost in the stream.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It’s apparent that how I share something and on what platform is important, if I want it to be accessible. My preference is that content is made available via:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The open web (for general traffic and new readers)</li>\n<li>RSS (for the more tech savvy - this is my preferred way of reading)</li>\n<li>Social media (short posts to syndicate to services like Micro.blog and Twitter and a good way of getting public comments)</li>\n<li>Email (for folks who like newsletters and for email replies, which are a good way to get private comments)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are four solutions of which I am aware that do all the above well. Write.as, Ghost, HEY World and Micro.blog. I know a lot of people like Write.as, which has a social component, somewhat similar to, but not as complete as Micro.blog and also has email options for blog posts. I haven’t tried <strong>Write.as</strong>, because honestly I don’t love the aesthetics and the theme or app design. I have tried <strong>Ghost</strong>, both self-hosted and the Ghost Pro hosted solution, several times. Although, I ran into a lot of trouble with Mailgun (for newsletters) and upgrades with self-hosted Ghost, so I don’t recommend that solution. Ghost Pro was really nice: increasingly stable and reliable with a set of features that was powerful but didn’t overwhelm. Their support team was responsive and helpful. Ghost is built for bloggers who want to “monetize their content,” though, and I’m not in that group. I’m writing because I enjoy it. I don’t want to strategize about expanding my audience, something Ghost is always pushing. So, for now, I’m sticking with <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">Micro.blog</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hey.com/world/\">HEY World</a>, the former for its customizability and social component, the latter for its complete lack of those features and its simplicity.</p>\n\n<p>I’m grateful that blogging services are starting to take into account all the ways people want to read writing from an independent publisher. This is especially helpful when, let’s face it, traditional blog commenting systems are not great. They invite half-baked responses (I was guilty of this, back in the day) instead of real conversation. Don’t even get me started on anonymous comments, which remind me most of someone yelling from a car window as they pass you by on the road. With email and some of the micro-blogging platforms, the discourse is improved, both privately and publicly, because of the robust ability of those systems to handle discussion and the level of accountability that comes with using a real identity (Twitter can sometimes be an exception here).</p>\n\n<p><em>Even with the popularity of social media, it has never been a better time to consider blogging. There are all sorts of ways to reach those who may want to read your thoughts.</em></p>\n",

The example that she hones in on is Kenya, where the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is trying to push \"market-based approaches\" to incentivize private actors in the healthcare space. In many case \"privatization\" becomes a euphemism for exploitation, just as \"consumer choice\" in healthcare is code for the patient pays the cost. While many countries around the world have capitalism as their economic model, it seem only the US has a sort of <em>hyper-capitalism</em>. </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Hyper-capitalism holds that nothing is too sacred, personal or integral to life to be off-limits to a profit motive. For instance, even in most capitalist countries (wealthy and not-so wealthy), healthcare is provided for citizens as a right. In the US, that cannot be the case, because private actors are making too much money to give up on their ability to extract capital from the most basic of human conditions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The United States famously spends more per capita on health care than any other country, even though the system performs far worse than that of many peer countries. Access is highly unequal, and sky-high prices push millions into poverty and discourage others from seeking care altogether. This heavily privatized system is indisputably excellent at one thing: generating profits. And powerful vested interests have blocked serious reforms for nearly a century. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Experience over the past year has cemented what reason and intuition had already led me to believe: for-profit healthcare dehumanizes people. I understand that the NHS in the UK is not perfect, and, in some cases, has ridiculously long waiting periods for care. I'm also under no illusion that Kenya has the best healthcare in the world. The care in those places, though, is setup to benefit the patient. Positive outcomes are when people get well, not when insurance companies make more money.</p>\n",

Ministry mastermind Al Jourgenson, or “Uncle Al” as he is affectionately known (probably as much for his crazy, constantly revised stories about his past as for his status as elder statesman and progenitor of the industrial genre of music) tried to erase this era of the band. Their first album, 1983’s <em>With Sympathy</em> was recorded for Arista Records who, according to Uncle Al, was constantly forcing him to compromise his artistic vision. When Ministry moved to Sire Records for their second album, 1986’s <em>Twitch</em>, Jourgenson disclaimed the first record and told fans to burn it.\n</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>During my teenage years, I was a pretty big Ministry fan. I once high-fived my friend Billy at the counter of a record store in my excitement about buying <em>In Case You Didn’t Feel Like Showing Up (live)</em>, causing him to light up with embarrassment. Jourgenson came up with sounds like no one else, despite other industrial music luminaries, like Trent Reznor, following in his wake. I never got into Nine Inch Nails, which a musician in my tenth grade creative writing class called “scary keyboard music.” I could admit the undeniable strength of a single like “Head Like A Hole,” but the rest of <em>Pretty Hate Machine</em> left me cold. Ministry on the other hand, sounded like someone hooked a distortion pedal up to a vacuum cleaner and ran it back and forth over bare floor and carpet (“Stigmata” and “Burning Inside”), creating some warped loop and stimulating my auditory nerves. </p>\n\n<p>Jourgenson, who wouldn’t really admit to playing any instruments, managed to create unmatched soundscapes from some dystopian future that might be fun to visit, but you wouldn’t want to live there. Computers, which even back then, were used by visionaries like Ministry to supplant traditional instruments and come up with something entirely new, sometimes disturbing, but frequently dopamine stimulating. Later on, Ministry lost that creative spark, due mostly to Jourgenson’s increasing dependence on heroin, which almost killed him several times over. </p>\n\n<h2>Back to the future</h2>\n\n<p>When I was regularly listening to Ministry, I knew of the existence of their earlier work and had heard from friends that it didn’t really sound like the same band. I had limited funds for music discovery, so I stayed away from it, just as Uncle Al would have wanted. I didn’t hear songs like “Work For Love” until I was well into my adult years, and was surprised by how good they were. Fortunately for listeners, <em>With Sympathy</em> is readily available on today’s streaming services. Fans also recorded footage of Ministry playing live during this era. Despite all his objections, Jourgenson looks perfectly happy to be playing these tunes. You can see his excitement when he preps the crowd for the song, with his faux-British accent, seeming like a Johnny Depp character in some futuristic pirate band. Back then, Patty Jourgenson, Al’s wife (before he was married to heroin) played keyboards in the group. The full band sounded cohesive and tight, putting on what must have been exhilarating shows for their audience.</p>\n\n<p><br>\n{{< youtube Ij1GeZGxhds >}} </p>\n\n<p>→ <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Ij1GeZGxhds\">Ministry - Work For Love, live in Boston, 1984</a></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>I wanted to include a video of the Burger King Super Bowl commercial from a few years ago that featured “Work For Love” but couldn’t find it anywhere on the widest of worldwide webs.</em></p>\n",

He goes to bed at about 10pm every school night, so he gets a decent amount of sleep. Yet, even though he has always been a morning person, he complains about feeling tired all day, every day, as he has to trudge through the morning darkness and cold to a nearby bus stop. When you look at the science behind teenagers and sleep, his response to his schedule isn’t surprising or unusual. In <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/daylight-saving-time-bad-teenagers/627095/\">Daylight Saving Is a Trap</a>, Heather Turgeon and Julie Wright emphasize what we have known from studies for quite a while: teenagers need more sleep, particularly in the morning. </p>\n<!--more-->\n<blockquote>\n<p>Too-early high-school start times already make healthy sleep difficult for teens, given this natural delay. The darker it is in the morning and the sunnier it is later in the day, the harder it is for them to get to bed on time. The result is shortened sleep, an increase in accidents, and a higher risk of depression.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As we cast about for reasons why kids are at increasing risk for mental health problems, as if we had no clues, we seem to be missing this obvious causal link. I nearly failed my second period chemistry class my junior year of high school. I just couldn’t stay awake. My teacher let me know it was a kindness that he was transferring me with a D. My grades improved dramatically in college, when I could take classes at reasonable times. </p>\n\n<p>As the Senate passes the “Protect The Sunshine” act, it will get worse for our high school youth. They will be even more bleary-eyed and tired in the morning during the winter. It feels like we are systematically putting unnecessary barriers in front of our kids. </p>\n",

I've started listening to my records again and I had forgotten how great they sound. I try to avoid being a vinyl snob (and my audiophile chops aren’t strong enough, anyway), but there is a warmth that I don't get from the various bluetooth and streaming devices I have scattered around. I know it can sound hokey to tout the presence that you get with analog, but there's something there that's hard to identify. </p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Alan Jacobs <a href=\"https://blog.ayjay.org/sounds/\">explains his return to vinyl:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>My good friend Rob Miner has a massive collection of LPs, but sometimes reminds me that he’s not a “vinyl fundamentalist.” And he’s not — but plenty of people are. And I have always been annoyed by the language of such fundamentalists: they talk about “warmth” and “presence” and “depth” — What the hell is that all about? Such metaphors have zero meaning to me. I scornfully dismissed all such talk … until I started listening to music on my new turntable. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jacobs is worried his new passion for records will turn him into <em>that guy</em>. He's finding more and more vinyl that captivates him and compels him in a way music doesn't on other mediums. </p>\n\n<p>There's something in those grooves that 1s and 0s don't completely capture. You don't have to have a super expensive hi-fi setup to notice it. My fairly basic <a href=\"https://uturnaudio.com/products/orbit-basic-turntable\">U-Turn Orbit turntable</a> and a pair of Kanto YU3 speakers that came with my 40th birthday prove that point. Yep, I got speakers for my turntable when I turned 40. I'm firmly in vinyl dad territory. I'm not a format fetishist but I value the experience of listening to music enough to prioritize it. Sometimes my son and I will sit in my office and listen to records together, something that we can't do in any of the computers that we use in separate spaces. </p>\n\n<h2>Peak vinyl</h2>\n\n<p>Even though vinyl sales are up year after year, the music industry is still treating its popularity like a short term fad that will end at any time. They haven't invested in vinyl presses despite more demand than the existing manufacturing infrastructure can effectively support. This has resulted in backlogs for vinyl that can stretch the patience of even the most ardent fan. My mom bought me a MUNYA record for Christmas that I'm hoping to get sometime in April. My wife ordered me a limited edition Roman à Clef record last year that just never came. <a href=\"https://www.daydreamrecordsofficial.com/\">The label</a> didn't respond when I emailed about it. I had to dispute the charge on my credit card to get a refund. </p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://frostedechoes-test.micro.blog/uploads/2022/778caf6dce.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>📈 Data viz <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/7699/lp-sales-in-the-united-states/\">via Statista</a></p>\n\n<p>I've been buying records since before '95, so I can remember those days when there weren't many people who were picking them up. Unfortunately, the rise in popularity has also meant a rise in prices commensurate with that increased popularity. I predicted that in a post on my Livejournal blog back in the early aughts. Specifically, my belief was that vinyl would be a premium experience with a premium price to match while digital distribution drove down the costs of most music. That aligns with the situation in which we have found ourselves.</p>\n\n<h2>Supporting artists</h2>\n\n<p>Another advantage to occasionally buying vinyl (I'm not rich, so I'm sticking with a reasonable level of frequency) is that I'm supporting the artists in a way that streaming from a major service does not. I have been writing on my blog about <a href=\"https://brothertiger.bandcamp.com\">Brothertiger</a>, one of my favorite bands, recently. I realized, though, that I had never really financially supported the band in any materially significant way. Sure, I could have bought some of their music through Bandcamp, but when you are getting the same digital artifact you can get for free through a streaming service, buying their music seems more like dropping coins in a tip jar than anything else. With lossless quality becoming the standard on the streaming platforms, buying a digital album on Bandcamp doesn't get you much besides ownership. However, when I saw a new limited edition splatter variant of the Brothertiger album <em>Out of Touch</em>, I was pretty excited. The band gets my financial support and I get something tangible to enjoy. </p>\n\n<p>Buying vinyl supports artists and can also be a good investment. I recently sold a few records that I no longer enjoyed on Discogs and made significantly more than I paid for the records originally. Not only that, but the buyers were really grateful to get their hands on some white whales for which they had scoured the seas. If you don't find yourself listening to a record, though, and you can't sell it for a decent price, you can always buy a record frame and hang it on the wall to enjoy the artwork. The generous size of the format makes it ideal as a decorative element for your listening room. I have IKEA shelves on which I display my records so that I can see some of my favorite covers and still easily pull the album off of the shelf and get a premium listening experience. </p>\n\n<p><em>Money is still a constraint with this hobby, but I'm glad to buy fewer records and give them more attention.</em></p>\n",

With Chromewaves, he was writing about new music coming out. He hustled to stay on top of the latest noises, but eventually burned out and shut the blog in 2013.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-19182\" id=\"fnr1-19182\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> This gave Yang the freedom to check out what he had been missing in the decades before he started really taking in music and then writing about it.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<blockquote>\n<p>I felt free to go back and explore and educate in private, and let me tell you – being able to listen to nothing but Bowie and Eno albums without having to write a single word about it was divine. I delved into the scenes and movements that laid the groundwork for the music I loved most and… I loved it even more. And now, seven years on, the bulk of my listening is of artists I rarely if ever blogged about; some I didn’t even know existed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Content as Yang is to go back even further than the shoegaze scene’s beginnings, he loves the shoegaze genre. In <a href=\"https://spaceecho.chromewaves.net/2022/03/16/curve-horror-head/\">his latest post</a>, he writes briefly about the history of Curve, why they don’t get as much attention as some of their peers and how their releases were so hard to find before they showed up on Bandcamp. He showcases the video for “Horror Head,” which is, most probably, my favorite shoegaze track. I love Toni Halliday’s ethereal vocals and the bass line that jumps all over the fretboard. I was smitten when I saw the video on 120 Minutes on MTV and went out and bought the <em>Doppleganger</em> CD. Its strange artwork of mutilated dolls reminded me of the doll terror in <em>Barbarella</em>. This was in the days before I could work and compact discs were something that I didn’t often have the money to buy. The disc was the last album I bought before moving from Virginia to Albuquerque, NM, in the eleventh grade.</p>\n\n<p>When I purchased it, <em>Doppleganger</em> was an almost total disappointment. I literally only liked the one song for which I had acquired it. I played the h*ck out of “Horror Head” and left the rest of the disc alone after a couple of initial listens. It made me sad because I knew what the band was capable of and yet they didn’t seem to be living up to their promise. I was also bummed because the drive from Virginia to New Mexico is a long one and I didn’t have new music to keep me company. </p>\n\n<p>In Albuquerque, I bought a goth magazine at some record store near UNM in downtown, and it had a feature on Curve. When I read the article, I couldn’t believe that singer Tony Halliday’s parents were actual legit pirates of the Caribbean. \n\n<p>I used to pass by the locker of a girl who had a Curve poster taped to the door and she would say things like, “aww, he got his hair cut” and other remarks that would make me blush. I was too chicken to talk to her because I had no idea who she was. She kind of reminded me of Halliday, though, who was the prototypical early nineties alterna-girl. </p>\n\n<p><em>Years later, watching this video still evokes a lot of memories.</em> </p>\n\n<p><br>\n{{< youtube Y3jYRP9jGKc >}}</p>\n\n<p>→ <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Y3jYRP9jGKc\">\"Curve - Horror Head\"</a>\n\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-19182\">\n<p>It was a bummer for me when Yang stopped posting to Chromewaves, as I was a regular reader.  <a href=\"#fnr1-19182\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

Her analysis on how the platforms accelerate what is already dissociative behavior from the human beings behind the keyboard draws parallels from unlikely places, such as urban planning. </p>\n<!--more-->\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Road design</em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORzNZUeUHAM&t=4s\"><em>in countries like the Netherlands</em></a> _promotes what is known as “traffic calming,” reducing pedestrian deaths and car accidents; by contrast, road design in North America promotes high-speed driving, passively nudging drivers to step on the gas, giving them less time to stop, even in crowded areas. Understood this way, you can get away from solely individualist narratives about accidents—about bad drivers or “pedestrians who weren’t looking”—and focus on how design encourages broad outcomes not attributable to any one actor. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, social media is designed in a way that agitates, rather than calms, its traffic. It leans into, rather than curbs, the augmented reality aspects that arise from computer use—tricking you into believing you’re somewhere other than reality._</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Our level of abstraction from a conversation on the internet breaks down the inhibitions that would normally be provided by our sense of empathy for others. That's the failure of our <strong>human</strong> moral and psychological underpinnings. The fault of the <strong>machine</strong> is in that it exacerbates and aggregates the failures of single individuals into a juggernaut with a powerful capacity for damage. The dynamics that play out in Twitter pile-ons is why I had my profile private for years and am still not totally comfortable with the fact that it's now public. The effects of being beaten down by a Twitter mob can be severe. Many of those so afflicted have serious mental health implications and suicidal ideation.  </p>\n\n<h2>The effect of being attacked and shunned</h2>\n\n<p>Cross uses specific examples of individuals who have been attacked on Twitter. In <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/russia-ukraine-war-cancel-putin-culture-war/626978\">a piece for the Atlantic</a>, Helen Lewis writes about the same effects that play themselves out in the narratives shared by Cross. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>A true cancellation typically involves the subject being cast out of their professional network, denied the ability to make money, and rejected by their social circle. One reason it is so alarming an experience is the sense of contagion—without obvious coordination, a person</em> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/10/new-puritans-mob-justice-canceled/619818/\"><em>becomes a nonentity</em></a><em>. Many of the canceled people I have known, or reported on, have experienced depression or even contemplated suicide.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lewis illustrates how Russian sanctions can show us the effects of ostracism.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>When a Russian spymaster complains about his country’s cancellation, our response should not be to laugh at an idiot confusing a culture war and a real one. Instead, we should recognize that economic and social isolation is a powerful weapon, and resolve to use it with the same restraint as any other weapon.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems the devastation that cancellation can bring applies at a macro or micro level. </p>\n\n<h2>A different way</h2>\n\n<p>You don't see the same dynamics on a social network like <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">Micro.blog</a>. The technology limits the snowball effect by the deliberate exclusion of features like the like and the retweet. Micro.blog also has a human being who manages the community and that gives people a level of accountability for their words.  When you are interacting with a faceless apparatus like Twitter, that same sense of accountability is not there. Cross has an accurate description of this phenomenon: \"There is a seductive quality to posting into the void, a Möbius strip sense that you’re the voyeur who no one <em>can</em> see, and the exhibitionist who everyone <em>must</em> see.\" </p>\n\n<p>How well can these measures work? The proof is in the pudding, as they say. On Micro.blog, people are rarely even impolite, never mind hostile. If someone does get a little too strident in their opinions, they usually back up and apologize. Micro.blog has different issues, and obviously community policing wouldn't scale to a very large network. It serves as a good example of ways to curb the excesses of the large social media networks, though. </p>\n\n<p>It's also worth remembering that the angry people on Twitter are usually a vocal minority. According to this <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/political-polarization-twitter-cable-news-ac9699c6-260d-4141-b511-5c7193566ea1.html\">short post</a> on Axios, <strong>75% of people in the U.S. never tweet</strong>.  </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>After my Lenten fast, I'll probably return to Twitter, but I'll be even more mindful of how the platform distorts our thinking.</em></p>\n",

We took many of our school field trips into D.C., including a few to the White House, and of course, to the plethora of wonderful museums that can be found in the district. My great aunt worked for several Republican politicians and made an identity out of her political affiliation. She wore jewelry with elephants. Great beasts made small to fit on a chain around her neck. She collected bicentennial quarters for me in a bag. I think it was to remind me that the 200 year anniversary of the nation's birth was also the year I came into the world. I loved that she took me to the White House Easter Egg roll. My sister and I got our picture taken with Spider-Man. I came away one year with an anti-drug comic book about the Teen Titans. The image of Speedy, all strung out on smack, haunted me as a child. I like to think that's exactly what Nancy Reagan would have wanted. One time I got to actually go into the Oval Office and leave jelly beans on the desk for President Reagan (his favorite candy).</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>In the days of my youth, there were inviolate dichotomies. You were either a fan of the Washington football team, or the one in Texas. Hulk Hogan was a hero, and The Iron Sheik a dastardly villain. The Rebel Alliance was a noble cause and the Galactic Empire a repressive regime. Christians were honorable and Satanists were immoral (which made for suitable teenage rebellion). The United States were the good guys and the Soviet Union were the bad guys. Allegiances were simple to discern. It got a bit more complex for me in the sixth grade when we had an exchange student from the U.S.S.R. I always knew that the people in Russia weren't bad, but it was the government that was the malignancy. To prove it, there was Ilia, in no uncertain terms, as innocent of any wrongdoing as we were (or probably more so). I was determined to treat him well, so I gave him a gummy worm. It was the kind with segments of different colors. He bit off one of the segments and gave the rest of the sticky candy back to me. I was astounded, thinking, <em>this kid doesn't even know how to eat a gummy worm but at least he seems nice</em>. Ilia was a slight kid like me, but when presented with a pull-up bar, he could put Schwarzenegger to shame. The Russians were physical fitness fanatics and every kid was a potential Olympian (athlete, not god). </p>\n\n<h2>One Hundred and Eighty Degrees</h2>\n\n<p>The world started to get even more nebulous as I got older. Things always turn out to be more complex than they seem when you were a child. It wasn't until the ascendancy of Donald Trump, though, that the world in which I grew up seemed to have flipped upside down. Mike Pence came to North Carolina and compared his running mate to Reagan. Meanwhile, Trump expressed his open admiration for dictators like Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong-un (and still does to this day). Many Americans, apparently tired of being thought of as the good guys, elected Donald Trump as president. His campaign was aided in victory by a Russian dictator and his disinformation apparatus plus a chief advisor who <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2016/11/18/dick-cheney-darth-vader-satan-that-is-power-steve-bannon-speaks-out-for-first-time-since-being-named-donald-trumps-top-white-house-adviser/\">openly worshipped Satan</a>. It's probably putting it too mildly to say that the 80s worldview that shaped my childhood was irreparably broken.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like those days of easy judgments are never coming back. Now everything takes so much discernment. Issues may have always been as complex as they are now, but they were simplified for our poor human brains. Low cognitive load used to be the social order of the day. Now we're inundated with news that we often don't know how to process. We still try to fit things in boxes, but they don't seem to settle as easily. Like a game of Tetris gone wrong, our pieces abut each other in strange angles with too many holes full of white space.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn't until the Russian invasion of Ukraine that we as a global community (not just Americans, this time) came together and saw the same thing. We saw a bully and an aggressor inflicting needless harm on a populace numbering the millions that was just starting to see growth and some measure of normalcy. No prescription adjustment needed and our vision was aligned, across most of the world. With all the complexity that has been introduced by modernism, does this moment illustrate a moment where all of that falls away, if briefly, just to show us what is really right and wrong? Will we at least pause in calling each other Nazis for the what material we believe is appropriate for our children or whether we think vaccines are necessary? <em>Will this be a clarifying moment that shakes us out of petty grievances and towards broader goals that benefit all of us?</em></p>\n\n<p>David French <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidafrench/status/1497745722145488904?s=21\">has a vain hope</a>, and perhaps so do I.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2022/01c1367d91.jpg\" alt=\"David French has a vain hope, and perhaps so do I.\" />\n",

In fact, I have struggled with the concept. The Got Questions site begins to answer the question of what imprecatory prayer is by <a href=\"https://www.gotquestions.org/imprecatory-prayer.html\">defining imprecatory</a>.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<blockquote>\n<p>To imprecate means “to invoke evil upon or curse” one’s enemies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It goes on to inform the reader that, in the Bible, David is the author of the most imprecatory psalms. These psalms, the site explains, were less about exacting vengeance on enemies than a recognition of the fact that God abhors evil and protects his chosen ones. David compares the enemies pursuing him to lions. It's almost as if the psalmists (David, Asaph and an unknown author) felt that they had to point out evil to God, as if He wouldn't otherwise take notice. They plead their case.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>More in number than the hairs of my head </p>\n\n<p>are those who hate me without cause; </p>\n\n<p>mighty are those who would destroy me, </p>\n\n<p>those who attack me with lies. </p>\n\n<p>What I did not steal </p>\n\n<p>must I now restore?</p>\n\n<p><em>(Psalm 69: 22-23)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Christian Prayer</h2>\n\n<p>As Christians, we don't focus a lot on prayers that our enemies come to ruin. It would run counter to the very words of Jesus to \"pray for those who persecute you\" <em>(Matthew 5:44-48)</em>. Praying for bad things to happen to bad people feels at odds with the philosophy shared by Jesus. However, what if those prayers serve as protection for those who would otherwise be prey in the jaws of lions? When do you pray for the lion to be crippled, so that the antelope can escape?</p>\n\n<p>These questions came to me as I prayed for the people of Ukraine a few nights ago. I asked myself what would it take to make them secure. The answer is for the aggression against them to cease. Nothing is impossible for God, but the hardened heart of Vladimir Putin seems difficult to penetrate. The salvation of the Ukrainian nation seems to depend on nothing short of the failure of the Russian war machine to accomplish its goals. It seems only natural to then pray for the total defeat of the Russian military forces and their commander-in-chief.</p>\n\n<h2>The Escape</h2>\n\n<p>In the book of Exodus, as the persecuted Israelites tried to escape the Egyptians, it was God's wrath visited upon the pharaoh and his forces that made their freedom possible. The pharaoh's heart was hardened, the book tells us, and he refused to have mercy on God's people. When Rome became an empire, the title caesar (the cognomen of Julius Caesar) was attached to its emperors, who behaved as the pharaohs did, and were worshipped and revered in the same ways. The title of caesar became czar in Russia when applied to its emperors. Although the reign of the czars technically ended with Nicholas II after he was deposed by the Bolsheviks, what is Vladimir Putin but a modern-day czar, with all of the powers to go with that designation?</p>\n\n<p>When a modern day czar invades another country and kills its people, are we at a point where we start to pray for his downfall? Presbyterian pastor Chris Hutchinson <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cahutch1990/status/1497936703490826244?\">thinks so</a>.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2022/e11779b657.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>I'm not sure where this leads. My crystal ball is in the shop. I also don't don't know how else to stem the tide. <strong>Prayer</strong> is what I know how to do right now. Even if that means praying to end the invasion by regime change, however that may happen.</p>\n",

We had a congregational meeting afterward, so my stomach was starting to get into growling mode by the time I got home.

When I heard my son yelling about the crucifix, it occurred to me that I’d rather have him in church with me. At least there he could be learning about the True Cross, rather than at home playing video games where the cross is merely a weapon to ward off monsters. I recently picked up Skye Jethani’s book, <em>What If Jesus Was Serious</em>, and had started reading it. Jethani describes the book as a devotional for people who hate devotionals. There were several retweets from Jethani’s Twitter account that were posted by people reading the book with their kids. What I had read of the book seemed a little over the level of a nine-year-old, but that can be mitigated by proper explanation of the concepts while reading. For instance, Chapter 2 focused on comparing ourselves to others when using social media. My son is a bit young for social media.

He came to this after leaving the Republican party in 2016:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since my political divorce, however, I’ve been able to see more clearly the nature of partisanship itself, including the way in which it distorts our view of the world. To use a legal analogy, at a fundamental level, partisanship converts a person from a judge (one who decides among competing arguments, hopefully without bias) to a lawyer (one who steadfastly and relentlessly defends their client, almost regardless of the facts). </p>\n\n<p>The partisan is prone to act like a lawyer, and the party is their client. He or she picks a side, and then—convinced that the common good or social justice is ultimately served by their triumph—behaves exactly how lawyers behave. Are there facts that make your “client” (Democrats or Republicans) look good? Emphasize those facts. Do negative developments harm your case? Find a way to change the focus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I love this so much. I've never thought about the subject using this framework, but it has long bothered me that people pick a side and then defend that side, no matter what. The paradigm that French, a former attorney, lays out is so appropriate, and so spot on. When you think about political issues, are you being a judge or a lawyer?</p>\n",

They are effectively unregulated securities where the only purpose of the products is price appreciation untethered to any economic activity. The only use case is gambling on the random price oscillations, attempting to buy low and sell high and cash out positions for wins in a real currency like dollars or euros. Yet crypto cannot create or destroy real money because unlike a stock there is no underlying company that generates income. So if you sell your crypto and make a profit in dollars, it’s exactly because a greater fool bought it at a higher price than you did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I remember many times people have tried to tell me that buying stocks is just gambling. Some people simply don't understand the purpose of an investment in a company that is creating value and being able to share a financial stake in that company's outcome. However, buying and selling cryptocurrency, as Diehl points out, does actually feel like gambling. </p>\n",

He writes about the episode in the first paragraph of his post. </p>\n<!--more-->\n<blockquote>\n<p>This morning I finished listening to what is undoubtedly one of the most listened to podcast episodes in the history of podcasting. You can listen to it here. In fact, I would encourage you to listen to it not because I’m convinced that everything said is absolutely true, but because being exposed to ideas that run contrary to conventional narratives is helpful and even necessary for clarifying our own thinking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>PolitiFact <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/jan/06/who-robert-malone-joe-rogans-guest-was-vaccine-sci/\">just reported on the suspension</a> of Dr. Malone from Twitter after his spreading of Covid-19 misinformation. The video of the interview was also banned from YouTube.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-21246\" id=\"fnr1-21246\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n> The platforms’ actions against Malone represent the latest efforts from Silicon Valley to crack down on harmful COVID-19 misinformation. Days earlier, Twitter suspended the personal account belonging to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., on the same grounds.\n\n<p>What I find most interesting about this scenario is how Ragsdale admits that he doesn’t care whether what is being said on the podcast is the truth. He comes right out and states that to preface everything that follows. I think it’s sad that he and many others (Ragsdale spends quite a few words on how impressed he is that Rogan has so many listeners) are more interested in having a counter-narrative to whatever the mainstream view is than actually being presented with the truth. Ragsdale is so awed by the number of followers that Joe Rogan is able to generate, which in itself he seems to think is some proof that his voice is credible. Of course, we know how easy it is for masses of people to be manipulated my misinformation, so the number of people convinced by lies doesn’t then lead credence to the lies. </p>\n\n<p>There’s a huge irony in the fact that Ragsdale spends much of his post talking about a lack of trust in mainstream media when he admits his own ideology biases him against whatever the mainstream media is promoting, even if it is the truth. This sort of obstinate stance has come to be characteristic of certain Christian circles and I know it damages the witness for Christ. As I’ve <a href=\"https://frostedechoes.com/fear-and-loathing-in-these-united-states/\">asked in the past</a>, how are people going to believe the miraculous stories of a savior that transcended death if his followers can’t even recognize obvious truths in front of them?</p>\n\n<p>I’ll let Hank Green close this post with a thought that seems to have some validity in thinking about the Joe Rogan phenomenon and why people cling to this type of media. </p>\n\n<p>{{< tweet 1477337857500925952 >}}</p>\n\n<p>After reading Ragsdale's piece, that seems about right. </p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-21246\">\n<p>I’m sure there are a certain segment of people who will think that means that the tech companies are trying to squash the facts.  <a href=\"#fnr1-21246\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

There are parents who blame the enforcement of mask rules for deteriorating mental health amongst students. These parents are frustrated and seeing their kids struggling encourages them to want to do something. </p>\n<!--more-->\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The dehumanization, isolation and fear mongering caused by all these mandates and COVID hysteria is literally killing our children,” Colleen Fleming, a parent, told the school board on Tuesday. “Understand this: Each and every one of you is complicit in the deterioration of our schoolchildren’s mental health and well-being and downfall of their academic success.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the parents in this case don't have a lot of evidence to back up their claims of a causation between wearing masks and mental health problems. Anecdotally, they have kids who are having difficulty with wearing masks. That is challenging. However, there are plenty of people who wear masks and don't have mental health issues. It's also important to remember why people are wearing masks. According to <a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article257062942.html\">this piece</a>, when a state board member questioned the effectiveness of masks, the NC health director, Dr. Betsey Tilson, pointed to 21 studies that show the benefit of wearing masks. </p>\n\n<p>The decline in mental health among children is an all-too-real phenomenon but it started before Covid even hit. Further decline was observed when Covid-19 came into the picture, but the possible causes for this are multi-factorial. When a society is faced with a pandemic, it causes additional stress to individuals (children and adults alike). </p>\n\n<p>It's a lamentable human tendency to find a scapegoat for problems. In this case, it's a shame that those who are truly doing their best to keep our students, teachers and education staff safe are bearing the brunt of the anger for this pandemic. </p>\n",

As I've [written in the past](/2021/01/10/inside-the-gallery.html), I believe companies should be allowed to set and enforce their own terms. \n\n{{< tweet 1477688016009375750 >}}\n\n→ [Twitter Permanently Suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Account | The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/02/technology/marjorie-taylor-greene-twitter.html)\n",

At first, I thought this was a fan-made video with the traditional fuzzy retro found footage. It wasn’t until the band was shown in the same style that I realized it was a legit official video for the song. This one has been in heavy rotation as part of my <em>The Noise That I Loved Best 2021</em> playlist. </p>\n\n<p>When my son heard this song, he asked if it was Joy Division. It is certainly indebted to the Factory Records sound. While this song sounds inspired by Joy Division, another single, “Tell Me” sounds more like New Order. It’s clear where Spectres influences lie. You just have to go back to Manchester about four decades ago. </p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>{{< youtube ODqZBktiyWs >}}</p>\n",

I really like the balance that she is able to strike between a fascination for work that requires a computer, and being able to extract time where she is not using a device.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>What I spend the majority of my time doing:</strong> Sitting in front of my computer.

It’s probably one of the simplest and best lifestyle changes I’ve made. It sounds obvious but not having devices in my room makes me sleep earlier, and better. I wake up with more energy and I’m more productive and creative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While most of what she does involves screen time, she also puts hard boundaries around those activities to make time for other enrichment. I would find the part about putting away electronic devices in my bedroom pretty difficult.

				"content_text": "Anne-Laure Le Cunff of Ness Labs [was just interviewed by Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/on-publishing-100-articles-in-100-days-and-crossing-100k-arr-anne-laure-le-cunffs-story-f99d8130c9). I really like the balance that she is able to strike between a fascination for work that requires a computer, and being able to extract time where she is not using a device. \n\n> **What I spend the majority of my time doing:** Sitting in front of my computer. Whether it’s learning, creating, connecting with other curious minds... I sometimes think it’s too much screen time, but there is such joy coming through this window on the world!\n\nOn her reading habit becoming a ritual: \n\n> Another thing that’s helped me move from routine to ritual is that starting last year, I’ve followed a strict rule of no electronic devices in my bedroom. It’s probably one of the simplest and best lifestyle changes I’ve made. It sounds obvious but not having devices in my room makes me sleep earlier, and better. I wake up with more energy and I’m more productive and creative.\n\nWhile most of what she does involves screen time, she also puts hard boundaries around those activities to make time for other enrichment. I would find the part about putting away electronic devices in my bedroom pretty difficult. I wouldn’t give up my Kobo, of course, but even when you have an iPad, that lean back device form factor makes it too easy to use when supine. The closest thing I’ve got to her resolve is to set downtime to 9:30pm, but even that is too easy to break by putting in my screen time code. \n\n",

This week I wanted to feature some sophisti-pop for comparison, but didn't want to go straight at it. So what we have here is Hoops covering Prefab Sprout (one of the more influential bands in sophisti-pop) staple \"Cars and Girls.\" </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>From The Beach Boys “I Get Around” to <em>American Graffiti</em> to <em>Sixteen Candles</em> or even <em>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</em>, cars and girls were central to the post-adolescent male imagination in the sixties through the eighties. The song explores when adulthood blooms and exposes the shallow thinking of youth. When life’s bigger problems come in, they start to crowd out the less important things we thought that carried so much weight when we were younger. As the apostle reminds us, “But now that I have become a man, I’ve put an end to childish things.” <em>(1 Corinthians 13:11, CEB)</em> </p>\n\n<p>In the video, the band poses, preens and prances around in an 80’s bimmer. The video is so tongue-in-cheek that it becomes almost unbearable at times, but the band’s mastery of the classic song more than compensates for the silliness. </p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>{{< youtube 2kL4lmnfTJQ >}}</p>\n\n<p>→ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kL4lmnfTJQ\">Hoops \"Cars and Girls\"</a></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>In America, those that lived during the time of World War II are often referred to as \"The Greatest Generation.\" Their level of self-sacrifice and dedication to their country and to freedom around the world will long be remembered by history. They can tell their grandchildren stories of courage and coming together. By contrast, I wonder sometimes if I'll be telling my grandkids about the selfishness of this moment in American history. Instead of defeating multiple powerful enemies around the globe, we'll be talking about how we defeated ourselves. That thought really hit me hard when reading <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/boebert-massie-gun-photo/620942/\">this piece</a> from Elizabeth Bruenig, regarding the recent photos of politicians and their families proudly holding assault weapons in front of Christmas trees. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m not triggered, as it were, by the mere sight of guns. And I tend toward the belief that there are so many guns in circulation and so risibly few politicians demonstrably invested in taking any kind of action on even meek and meager <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/03/guns-are-threat-body-politic/618158/\">changes to gun policy</a> that there’s not much point in talking about it anymore. Our own politicians are celebrating guns at Christmas mere days after a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/12/michigan-shooting-chris-murphy-newtown/620881/\">school shooting</a> precipitated by the purchase of a handgun for the perpetrator as—yes—a Christmas gift. America armed its civilians with so many guns that it conquered itself. I guess this is defeat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Many knew that the ordinary, sane people who just want their kids to be able to be safe in schools had lost the battle after nothing was done following the Sandy Hook tragedy. Then-president Obama called that the <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/barack-obama-says-congress-lack-action-after-sandy-hook-was-angriest-day-his-presidency-1547282\">angriest he had ever been</a> as president. We've gone from inaction on the part of politicians to blatantly flaunting weapons with kids directly following another school tragedy. We went from those tragedies being outliers to being fairly commonplace. If a foreign enemy was killing our children in their schools, there would be outrage. We would vow to vanquish our foes. In our present situation, as Bruenig says, we allow or even architect our own defeat. </p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2021/8f4a8ca875.jpg\" />\n<figcaption>\nImage Source: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jayrheike\">Jay Heike</a> on Unsplash\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>It looks like the Onion will be able to keep rerunning their famous satirical article, <a href=\"https://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-this-r-1819576527\">‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens</a> from 2014. This piece will be evergreen because the situation won't change in America. Since part of our legislative branch of government seems to think it's their primary job to \"trigger the libs,\" they will keep flaunting our loss.

In short, because it's easy and cheap and pays big dividends. People love to read it for that confirmation bias rush and you don't have to be an expert in anything, such as science or politics. You don't even <em>have</em> to do research or risk getting called out for being wrong. </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>This makes cultural commentary especially tempting for politicians. It saves them from actually having to talk about the details of their jobs or what they are doing for their constituents.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Complaining about culture wars is easy for politicians because there’s little for them to do so they can’t be blamed for inaction. When Congress was debating the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion spending bill, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sen-cruz-sells-signed-dr-seuss-books-green-eggs-and-ham-2021-3\">Sen. Ted Cruz</a> (R-Texas) and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-mccarthy-dr-seuss-video-reading-green-eggs-and-ham/\">Rep. Kevin McCarthy</a> (R-Calif.) were busy reading Dr. Seuss because of a controversy over some of his books being racist and the publisher deciding not to publish them anymore. Writing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1354848253729234944?lang=en\">mean tweets</a> or <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/verdict-with-ted-cruz/id1495601614\">hosting podcasts</a> filled with culture war commentary counts as a substitute for “doing something,” whereas legislators used to be judged based on their lawmaking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Politicians aren't the only ones engaged in the cultural hot take trend, though. Journalists of all stripes, writing for a full spectrum of different audiences, have really taken up the format. Nowrasteh describes one particularly popular style of article that has been around for the last few years.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Journalism and commentary also thrive on unconventional narratives that cultural commentary is well suited to produce. “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/29/marijuana-name-cannabis-racism\">This</a> <a href=\"https://time.com/5593706/hard-work-achievement-mindset/\">culturally</a> innocuous thing is <a href=\"https://www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk/why-it-matters/\">actually evil</a>” is so ubiquitous that it should be its own genre with a specialized name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This genre (whatever you want to call it) has me wondering what this Christmas season's version of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/rankin-bass-rudolph-the-red-nosed-reindeer/616932/\">Don't Subject Your Kids to Rudolph</a> is going to be. These stories are another version of the <a href=\"\">man bites dog</a> aphorism in journalism. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The phrase <strong>man bites dog</strong> is a shortened version of an aphorism in journalism that describes how an unusual, infrequent event (such as a man biting a dog) is more likely to be reported as news than an ordinary, everyday occurrence with similar consequences, such as a dog biting a man.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's not hard to write and back these pieces, because all they require is a knowledge of the cultural artifact, the shared accepted meaning behind that artifact and a different opinion. Some may roll their eyes, but it's hard to really contest such a piece in any real sense. </p>\n\n<p>Given the low-cost at which these articles can be tossed out, and the high rewards of readership, don't expect them to disappear anytime soon. </p>\n\n\n  \n",

I got to the part about Russia helping to provide the autocratic guidebook to Belarus' dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, in order to crush the protests in the country. I got this feeling in my core that I was at my limit of bad news for the day. </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>This month's Atlantic is full of depressing material, including even a story about <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/12/charles-conwell-boxing/620527/\">a boxer that killed another boxer</a> in the ring and then resumed his career boxing (and was even directed by a Christian pastor to do so).</p>\n\n<p>I went upstairs and got on my iPad to check my email. I had a weekly article roundup message from the Matter service. The first story being promoted was called \"The Case for Optimism.\" It struck me that this was exactly what I needed to be reading. I saved the article to Pocket to read later on my Kobo. It turned out the article was written by Kevin Kelly, the founder of Wired Magazine, and a technology optimist. Kelly is also just a glass half-full guy in general. In <a href=\"https://www.warpnews.org/premium-content/kevin-kelly-the-case-for-optimism/\">the piece</a>, that he wrote for Warp News, a few months back, he lays out his case for looking on the bright side. While I was reading the article, and before I had realized who Kelly was, I had a little skepticism about what he was writing. His projections for a better future were highly speculative, although they were based current and very possible upcoming technological advances. It reminded me a bit of those who predicted that the rise of computers and automation would give us humans more leisure time only to be proven not only wrong, but wrong in the completely opposite direction. As many an article has explored recently, we've mostly taken automation and efficiency and filled up whatever time it's given us often times with more ways to be available for work (though I am blessed to work for a company with a good culture around work/life balance). </p>\n\n<p>When I got to the end of the article, I read the bio and realized who it was that had written the piece. I wrote <a href=\"https://frostedechoes.com/2021/01/24/the-luddite-versus.html\">a blog post</a> earlier this year about a wager that Kevin Kelly made years ago, based on similar technologically-driven optimism. When examining Kelly's claims now, it's important to remember that, after 25 years, the outcome of the wager was barely decided in Kelly's favor, despite the fact that his opponent, neo-Luddite Kirkpatrick Sale, had predicted nothing less than societal collapse. If that doesn't make you wary of accepting Kelly's claims uncritically, I don't know what would. </p>\n\n<p>Kelly makes prognostications such as ubiquitous AI replacing jobs that humans don't want to do, while humans are left for \"innovation, entrepreneurship, art, caring, hospitality, science and discovery.\" We don't value those who make art, provide care and hospitality services now and I'm not sure how advances in AI are going to change that dynamic and mentality. He also mentions universal connectivity enabling cooperation at a scale never before possible. If something like Facebook is to be taken as an example of universal connectivity (and it probably should be, since it has the largest user base of any communications platform), then greater connectivity will lead to greater division and deception. </p>\n\n<p>I hate to be a downer and feed the stereotype of the pessimist that Kelly creates. It's hard not to be, though, because the techno-utopian dreams that have been constructed have gone so wrong. In the end, though, Kelly thinks we'll be able to solve the problems that have arisen from technological progress.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We should be optimistic not because our problems are smaller than we thought, but because our capacity to solve them is larger than we thought.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would love to believe this overall premise, but it hasn't been born out by the events of the last few years. Even scientific miracles like hastily created mRNA vaccines can't succeed if the people involved in ensuring their success don't perform their part in that process. It seems as if technological advances of the last few years have only served to shine a spotlight on our broken humanity. None of what Kelly brings up convinces me that's going to change anytime soon. I'm glad that my hope does not stem from technology or people. </p>\n",

Once the sale occurred, the buyer messaged me that he had questions and wanted me to text him. I thought it was strange, because normally questions are asked before a purchase. However, the buyer had a good rating, so I reached out over text. He asked me about the condition of the item (it was brand new, as the listing indicated). He also wanted more pictures but there was really nothing more to give him. He said he was going to pay via PayPal, but wanted the item shipped to his cousin as a present. I was willing to ship the item wherever. Then he started asking me to buy $400 in gift cards to put in the box and that he would cover the expense plus extra for gas and hassle. Red flags were going up all over the place. I told him no and contacted eBay. They did an investigation. It turned out the legitimate account had been hacked and someone was using it to scam people.</p>\n<p>The account was returned to its rightful owner and I was told that the transaction had been canceled. I had to go through and relist the item again (I was surprised eBay didn&rsquo;t do that automatically). The next time I listed the item, it went through a week without any bids, at which time eBay automatically lowered the price a bit (which is a cool feature). Almost immediately after it was lowered, I had a bid for the asking price. I accepted right away. Almost as quickly, I had a message from the buyer that he had a question and wanted me to text him. I replied that I would answer any questions over the eBay messaging system. I got another message that was the same as the first. I let a couple of days go by, and with no other word, called eBay. They told me to cancel the sale and confirmed my suspicion that scam artists were on the lookout for sellers with low ratings. I asked how I’m supposed to sell in that environment, but the support rep had no response to my question.</p>\n<p>I’m not sure how people would get started selling on eBay at this point, being at the mercy of successive scammers.

He also wanted more pictures but there was really nothing more to give him. He said he was going to pay via PayPal, but wanted the item shipped to his cousin as a present. I was willing to ship the item wherever. Then he started asking me to buy $400 in gift cards to put in the box and that he would cover the expense plus extra for gas and hassle. Red flags were going up all over the place. I told him no and contacted eBay. They did an investigation. It turned out the legitimate account had been hacked and someone was using it to scam people. \n\nThe account was returned to its rightful owner and I was told that the transaction had been canceled. I had to go through and relist the item again (I was surprised eBay didn't do that automatically). The next time I listed the item, it went through a week without any bids, at which time eBay automatically lowered the price a bit (which is a cool feature). Almost immediately after it was lowered, I had a bid for the asking price. I accepted right away. Almost as quickly, I had a message from the buyer that he had a question and wanted me to text him. I replied that I would answer any questions over the eBay messaging system. I got another message that was the same as the first. I let a couple of days go by, and with no other word, called eBay. They told me to cancel the sale and confirmed my suspicion that scam artists were on the lookout for sellers with low ratings. I asked how I’m supposed to sell in that environment, but the support rep had no response to my question.\n\nI’m not sure how people would get started selling on eBay at this point, being at the mercy of successive scammers. I’ve heard Craig’s List referred to as “Flake’s List,” so I’m not sure things are better over there. Where are people selling online these days, I wonder?\n\n",

				"content_text": "<p>On the iA blog, <a href=\"https://ia.net/topics/on-apps-and-coffee\">Oliver Reichenstein argues</a> that apps are more like coffee makers than the cups of coffee to which they are always related. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If there is a valid coffee comparison it’s the coffee maker. Productivity apps are not consumed. Productivity apps are tools. They help you make things. Great apps help you make nice things. Pro apps help you make pro things. How could a text editor compete with an espresso machine?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since I don't buy a daily cup of coffee, I never got the frequent comparison of subscription prices to cups of coffee. It's overused and doesn't provide context for many people. I think the suggestion that a writing app is equivalent to a coffee maker is a better analogy. Which ultimately means, a piece of software makes more sense with a perpetual license like that which is employed with iA Writer. </p>\n",

The trailer for the show promised exciting visuals and an intriguing plot. The review from the site <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/foundation\">Common Sense Media</a> was mostly very positive. The write-up on the show focused quite a bit on the show's diverse cast and little on the violence. The quick summary on the site encapsulates their review well: </p>\n\n<p>\"Cerebral sci-fi drama has diversity, some violence.\" Representation is important, but I'm ashamed that we've become so saturated in violence that we consider the level this show contains barely worth mentioning. </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2>Fictional violence</h2>\n\n<p>In the universe of <em>Foundation</em>, a powerful empire rules over many planets. In a scene from episode two, we are shown how the empire responds to acts of terrorism. They find scapegoats for the act and target vengeance upon token individuals from the scapegoated populations in a town square setting. The indviduals are masked and made to stand on the edge of a building rooftop with a neuse tied around their necks. Each faceless character was kicked off of a roof to hang by their surely broken necks. The show wasn't shy about stretching this out, showing each individual being kicked off one a time and their dead body twisting in the wind. It was reminiscent of what Saddam Hussein used to do with people that he wanted to eliminate. While this was happening, weapons of mass destruction were being deployed on the entire populace of two planets, while their ambassadors wailed and screamed at the fate of their fellow citizens back home. During the incredibly visceral ordeal, crowds, shown on the balconies of their spartan apartments, cheered in triumph. What made the scene even worse for the viewer was knowing that the people being punished were not guilty of any wrongdoing, but were simply the targets in an exercise of force. They were victims of an act of genocide for show. When the show was over, a traumatized boy is brought over to the hanging dead bodies. He asks if they ever handle these situations differently and is told no. </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Violence in television and movies has become so mainstream that even sites specifically created to surface it aren't up to the job.</h3>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>In the same episode, we see one of the protagonists brutally stabbed to death by his protege, his life blood oozing across the floor. The murder is done with no context, and is shocking. The frantic scene that follows gives no more information on why the murder happened. The viewer is left, potentially emotionally damaged, all in the service of trying to squeeze a cliffhanger in to draw people into the next episode. It's crass and manipulative. </p>\n\n<h2>Real-life violence</h2>\n\n<p>When I was in the eleventh grade, I lived in Albuquerque, NM, which was, at the time, second in the nation in gang activity. It could be a rough place and in high school, you learned to keep your head low (literally, lest someone you looked in the eyes think you were mad dogging them). The high school I went to was the same high school that Neil Patrick Harris attended, though he was two years ahead of me and graduated the year before I was there. That same year, a boy from the school was killed in the parking lot because he had allegedly said something bad about his murderer. I only heard stories, but I'm sure Harris remembers the incident, which would have happened when he was a senior. The part that disturbed me most about the stories that I heard was that a crowd had gathered around the conflict and were chanting, \"kill him.\" I can never get that out of my mind. The bloodlust of the crowd depicted in <em>Foundation</em> brought back for me the ugly reality of human nature. </p>\n\n<h2>When sense is no longer common</h2>\n\n<p>This show and its evaluation on Common Sense Media shows that I can no longer rely on that site for giving reliable information with which to judge whether a show is too violent (for me, or my kids). Violence in television and movies has become so mainstream that even sites specifically created to surface it aren't up to the job. It's frightening what that says about us. </p>\n",

A couple of days after the procedure, I ruptured a blood vessel in my gum. I spent all night spitting out blood into a bucket. I stuffed tea bags into my mouth, hoping the tannin would stop the bleeding. It didn't. </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>As soon as the morning came, I phoned my oral surgeon and told him in some graphic detail of my plight. He seemed annoyed at my sense of urgency, but agreed to meet me as soon as his office opened for the day. When I got to the office, the doctor seemed surprised. \"You really are bleeding!\" I reminded him that I had mentioned that on the phone. \"Yeah, but everybody says that,\" he told me. He stitched me up and left me to ride out the next several days feeling like someone was trying to rip the jaw off of my face. </p>\n\n<p>The experience left me wondering how people who are honest are impacted by the dishonesty of others. The surgeon had openly admitted to taking my claim less seriously because his experience had taught him that people often exaggerate the state of post-surgery complications. I was able to get the care I needed, but are there situations where appropriate medical care is not received, because the care provider doesn't understand the severity of the case at hand. I imagine this could come into play in an emergency care environment where triage is being done. In such an environment, the order in which people get care is critical. What if someone is not believed, and they don't get the care they need in time to prevent further escalation of a health issue? Or worse, what if there are additional complications because the patient did not get attention quickly enough?</p>\n\n<p>There are times when this dynamic comes into play and we don't even realize it. We can't always know when people are being dismissive, and, even if it's obvious, we don't always know why. An obvious case came up again recently in my life, though. I was trying to sell a pinball machine. The guy who was attempting to line up a buyer was helping me price the sale, sight unseen. He tried to talk me down from my original price, even though I told him the machine was in good condition and completely in working order. The attempt to talk me down wasn't coming from self-interest, because he wasn't going to be buying the machine. He was just trying to help me come to a reasonable price at which the machine would sell fairly quickly.</p>\n\n<p>When the individual who was helping me by acting as the middleman came to assess the machine, he expressed surprise that it was in such good condition. I mentioned that I had told him it was in good shape and he responded that everyone says that. It struck me as another situation where those of us trying to be honest are saddled with expectations that other people who are less scrupulous have set. </p>\n\n<p>In discussing this with someone else, I was reminded that, in these instances, people may not necessarily be dishonest, but may simply not have the knowledge to best described their experiences. That seems right for some people, and probably not for others. I'm really concerned with the others, where I think distrust becomes transitive and affects the people who don't do anything to court it. </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Our Daily Bread has <a href=\"https://discoveryseries.org/courses/why-doesnt-god-answer-me/\">an insightful lesson</a> on Psalm 77, in which Asaph unloads his anguish onto God. Asaph has been praying for God to help him in his distress, but is not seeing the fruits of his prayer made manifest. He wonders if God no longer hears him or has changed from the gracious God that Asaph knew in former days. </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I cry out loud to God— </p>\n\n<p>out loud to God so that he can hear me!</p>\n\n<p>During the day when I’m in trouble I look for my Lord.</p>\n\n<p>At night my hands are still outstretched and don’t grow numb;</p>\n\n<p>my whole being refuses to be comforted. <em>(Psalm 77:1-2, CEB)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the lesson, the Ray Stedman makes the somewhat radical argument that prayer is not the first thing we should do when in trouble. After all, God is not a vending machine in the sky, where you press the button for the item you want and receive it. Stedman notes the diminishing faith in Asasph when his prayers go unanswered. In his desperate situation, Asasph does not eventually receive hope through prayer, but through meditation on the very character of God. By the end of the chapter he is singing praises about the nature of God. Stedman concludes that we start not first with prayer, but with meditation on the immutable character of God.</p>\n",

I don't know what criteria gets you added to the Matter list of authors, but ultimately it seems like just another group of editors deciding whose work gets put out there. *So much for the democratization power of the internet.*\n\n---\n\n*If you are interested in Matter, Matt Birchler has [a more comprehensive evaluation](https://youtu.be/Fa-r-b_s8gc) on his YouTube channel, A Better Computer. *\n\n\n[^1]:\tWhich is certainly one of the most important features in a read-it-later app. \n",

In both instances, the groups had lost faith in God to protect them and wanted to rely on a strong man. In the biblical book of Samuel, a king was requested of the prophet, a request which he initially rebuked. Eventually, after Samuel spoke with God, on the Lord's command, he relented and found the people a king in the form of a man named Saul. His change of heart came with a strict warning to the people of how a king would treat them. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>When Christians started favoring eliminating the legislative and judicial branches of the government, it looked like they wanted Donald Trump to be the next Saul. Supporters who back autocracy might not be the only thing that the Donald has in common with old king Saul. Consequence of Sound has <a href=\"https://consequence.net/2021/09/music-man-show-tunes-trump/\">a post</a> about a “music man” who played show tunes to tame then president Donald Trump when he was at his most difficult.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to a new book by former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, the “music man” was the only person who could manage Trump’s “terrifying” temper, playing hit songs from musicals to help calm him down.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This reminds me of Saul, who would go into deep boughts of depression that were only relieved by the music of his successor to the throne, David. <em>Psychology Today</em> <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-power-music/201704/the-world-s-first-music-therapist\">has an account</a> of the healing properties of music, using this biblical example. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The verses told the story of King Saul who had become tormented by a feeling of melancholy. Saul’s servants suggested that they find a musician who could play for him to soothe his psyche. One of the servants suggested a young man named David who he heard was a skilled musician. Saul was in agreement and so the servants went to find the young David and brought him to King Saul. It then says the following: “And it happened that whenever the spirit of melancholy from God was upon Saul, David would take the lyre (harp) and play it. Saul would then feel relieved and the spirit of melancholy would depart from him” (I Samuel, 16:23).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Saul was not only melancholy, though. He was frequently calmed from great anger by David’s music. The piece goes on to refer to David as a “musical therapist.” I’m intrigued by the continuing parallels between Saul and DT beyond just the demands of their constituencies. The fact that both of them, who came to power in similar circumstances, needed musical therapy, proves to an even greater extent that ancient stories have current applications. I'll keep studying my bible.</p>\n",

The indie rock scene was maturing and new artists were building on what their predecessors had created.</strong> </p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2021/a776a30bee.jpg\" alt=\"Source: My 7&quot; collection.\" />\n<figcaption>Source: My 7&quot; collection.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Garrett Martin <a href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/indie-rock/best-indie-rock-albums-of-1995/\">writes for Paste Magazine</a> about the seminal year for indie rock that was 1995 and the top 20 albums in the loosely knit genre from that year.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>After a brief period where the distinction between major labels and indie labels blurred, the value and significance of independent music became clear again. Indie labels gave both musicians and fans a legitimate alternative to the bland, cookie-cutter rock music that had taken over MTV programming and alternative radio station playlists by the start of 1995. That freedom resulted in an unusually fruitful year in 1995, with some of the best bands of the era releasing some of their best music. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That year looms particularly large in my memory because it contained the latter half of my first year of college and a battle with cancer. The nostalgia factor from this piece almost gives me goosebumps. I either owned or borrowed most of these albums in 1995. Of particular importance to me were <em>Wowee Zowee</em>, <em>The Dirt of Luck</em>, <em>Get Lost</em>, <em>Me Me Me</em> and <em>Electr-O-Pura</em>. I had <em>Wild Love</em> by Smog, but couldn’t process its darkness through the ordeal of my cancer diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n\n<p>When Martin writes about the acts from Lollapalooza that year, I remember having to make the tough choice to see Built To Spill on the side stage instead of Beck on the main stage. To this day I've never seen Beck play. I've seen Built to Spill several times, but I've never regretted choosing what was one of my favorite bands at the time. Local heroes Superchunk joined Built to Spill on the side stage and were hyper enough to get the crowd going.</p>\n\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4163826874/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=e99708/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=141410710/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"https://superchunk.bandcamp.com/album/heres-where-the-strings-come-in-remastered\">Here&#39;s Where the Strings Come In (Remastered) by Superchunk</a></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Due to my cancer treatment, my dad was able to wrangle me seats in the handicapped section, which was pretty close to the main stage. Pavement played a bit later on in the day, and for that we took seats near the front (though not in the handicapped section). The PA's were blasting electronic music when the band came out and lead malkmusician Steve Malkmus strode up to the microphone and promptly said, &quot;turn that sh*t off.&quot; It would be years and a life lived in Berlin later that would finally bring him around to that genre. It was a good show, though Pavement was never the tightest live band. </p>\n\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3991572627/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3877440117/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"https://pavement.bandcamp.com/album/wowee-zowee\">Wowee Zowee by Pavement</a></iframe></p>\n\n<p>I spent a lot of time reading that summer. There wasn't much else to keep me occupied and the internet had not yet become ubiquitous. One of my favorite reading experiences was poring through A Prayer for Owen Meany. It reminded me that even adversity has a purpose in life and helped strengthen my budding faith. My then ex-girlfriend from high school (now wife) has recommended it and had a passion for John Irving novels. I remember the Magnetic Fields' Get Lost LP being the soundtrack to much of that reading. That was a recommendation from my best friend, who later conversed with the Fields' mastermind, Stephin Merritt, on the subject of crying.</p>\n\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1294509798/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3780987314/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"https://themagneticfields.bandcamp.com/album/get-lost\">Get Lost by The Magnetic Fields</a></iframe></p>\n\n<p>It's taken for granted that any time spent with cancer and scorched earth chemotherapy is going to be tough, but I'll always remember that as one of my favorite summers. Music from that time of my life is still the surest way to bring back memories of 1995.</p>\n",

As I mention in my bio, I'm a prolific notetaker. I would consider myself a digital pack rat, if not hoarder. Very few articles make it through my reading cycle without some highlighting and marginalia. Not a whole lot of meetings go undocumented. I collect, I share. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>It wasn't until recently that my patterns of behaviors became a problem. It's not an issue to hoard digitally, you can do it at very little expense and keep things nice and tidy. It's not like accumulating physical assets, where you run out of space and crowd yourself out. Unfortunately, I haven't been keeping my data organized. Here are some examples of the messiness of my digital life.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Sites that I want to return to may be added to Pinboard, or to a Bear note, or to Drafts, or as bookmarks in my browser.</li>\n<li>Quotes that I want to keep or reference later may be in Instapaper as highlights, in Drafts as a draft, in a blog post in IA Writer, etc.</li>\n<li>Photos and screenshots that I've collected for a blog post might be in Photos or somewhere in my files.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>At some point in the last few years, my digital garden has grown a lot of weeds.</h3>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>After the titular character in Voltaire's <em>Candide</em> had traveled the world, witnessing the atrocities and ridiculousness of mankind, he settled down in a home to mind his own business. The metaphor for his state of domesticity is tending a garden. It couldn't be more apt right now, when we have disruption and human beings at their worst in the chaos we read about every day. A place to withdraw and manage could be therapeutic indeed. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Candide, as he was returning home, made profound reflections on the Turk’s discourse. “This good old man,” said he to Pangloss and Martin, “appears to me to have chosen for himself a lot much preferable to that of the six kings with whom we had the honor to sup.” … “Neither need you tell me,” said Candide, “that we must take care of our garden.” “You are in the right,” said Pangloss; “for when man was put into the garden of Eden, it was with an intent to dress it: and this proves that man was not born to be idle.” “Work then without disputing,” said Martin; “it is the only way to render life supportable.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>~ <a href=\"https://oll.libertyfund.org/quote/voltaire-in-em-candide-em-says-that-tending-one-s-own-garden-is-not-only-a-private-activity-but-also-productive-1759\">Candide by Voltaire</a></p>\n\n<p>I don't have a lot of energy to expend, these days. A solid system to manage information can actually save me work. So I listened to the hype around <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> from those I follow on social networks and decided to give it a try. At first I was skeptical, and feature for feature, could find most of its power in other tools. The app is cross-platform and it shows. You can tell by the UI and controls it's not a native app on MacOS/iOS. However, I still like the design with the <em>Minimal</em> theme installed. It certainly doesn't stick out like running Emacs on a Mac. It looks better than some native apps like Scanner Pro on iPadOS. </p>\n\n<p>Once I started to watch videos of how people, like Chris Wilson, were using Obsidian for Bible study, things started to click for me. You can checkout Chris' newsletter, <em>Biblically Connected</em>, <a href=\"https://biblicallyconnected.substack.com/\">here</a>. It is a good source for collections of his and other's ideas about personal knowledge management (PKM). It's focused around biblical study, but is broadly applicable. The user base for Obsidian is growing, and its fans are devoted. They're using their Obsidian vaults for keeping track of all kinds of data. </p>\n\n<p>If you like plain text and markdown, give Obsidian a look or two.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-11761\" id=\"fnr1-11761\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> The whole system is comprised of plain text files using markdown, so it's future proof, and the risk of adopting the app is low. It might help you beautify your digital garden. </p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-11761\">\n<p>Don't give up on the first try.  <a href=\"#fnr1-11761\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

I was drawn in by the stylized artwork and colorful pastels on the album cover of their newest offering, <em>Leisure</em>. The contents of the album sound exactly like you would expect from looking at the cover. Over-the-top synths bathe the listener in the color palette of the 1980's. The aesthetic is so completely intact, that the opening track, \"Gallery,\" sounds like it was pulled from an 80's film about Wall Street.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>At times, the synthisizer parts sound a bit like a softer, more radio friendly, Com Truise or a band on Jim Smith from Teeel's <a href=\"https://synthrecords.bandcamp.com/\">Synth Recordings</a> label. While the synths dominate, though, there are other instruments that also cling tightly to the sounds of the Regan era. Ostentatious guitar solos pop up in places like the track \"Lifetime\" and remind you of the chase scenes that were a staple of blockbusters and b-movies alike back then. </p>\n\n<p>Most of the album is instrumental. It's a surprise when, the vocals appear four songs into the affair, in \"About You.\" With vocals in the mix, the band reminds me of Sophie and Peter Johnston, albeit with less range and variation. </p>\n\n<p>You won't find a shortage of bands showing their allegiance to the sonic staples of the 80's.

One particular corner of the internet where it has received significant buzz is the Micro.blog community. The attention is both surprising and not surprising. It's not surprising because that community tends to be very tech literate and have a great curiosity for new apps and platforms, such as social networks, email tools, blogging services or note taking apps. A well made app like Glass with a user base that already seems to be passionate is bound to be a topic of discussion on the M.b. network of federated blogs. The enthusiasm is also expected because Micro.blog has quite a few very talented photographers that use the service. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>What is surprising, though, is that Micro.blog already has a vibrant photo sharing community and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sunlit/id1334727769\">an app</a> that specifically supports it. People are already engaged in photo sharing and discussions that grow around that activity on Micro.blog. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, Glass has adopted many of the same design principles that power Micro.blog. You might even call it \"opinionated software.\" Matt Birchtree lists some of the elements of Glass in <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/the-instagram-replacement-for-photographers/\">his post on the app</a>, and I've pulled out the ones that match Micro.blog.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If you do want to find someone to follow, there is a whole other tab with a list of suggested accounts. These appear to be accounts the app makers like, not ones based on who you already follow.</li>\n<li>There are basically no metrics in the app. You don't know how many people liked a photo, how many followers people have, and you can't even see how many followers you have! In short, this is not a popularity contest.</li>\n<li>You can't even like a photo in the first place. The only interaction is to leave a comment. This makes it harder to show appreciation for the shots you like, but it also makes it feel more engaging since you find yourself trying to think of something to say to people. Why did you like it? Do you have a question about the gear used? It's very clever.</li>\n<li>There are also no hashtags. This is actually something I hope they add in some form later, since finding types of photographers is always nice. Let's just lock it down maybe so we don't get 30 hashtags in every post like you have to do on Instagram.'</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It almost seems like the plot of a movie where the protagonist searches for love, only to realize that they had it the whole time in someone who was already their best friend. It will be interesting to see how the Glass community grows and if it offers additional value to the folks already using Micro.blog. </p>\n\n<p><em>I've included some samples of photos shared on Micro.blog, so that you can get a sense of the kind of exceptional output on the service.</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><br></p>\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" data-title=\"\" data-author=\"Holly Honeychurch\" data-avatar=\"https://micro.blog/hollyhoneychurch/avatar.jpg\" cite=\"https://blog.hollyhoneychurch.com/2021/08/19/got-my-haircut.html\"><p>Got my hair cut from a sweet, wise, bubbly lady called Yvonne.

Other than that, there were some helpful suggestions about things she wanted. I never asked her directly why the caveat about where items were purchased. I didn’t do so because it seemed obvious that there were a number of reasons a person would not want to support Amazon. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>In his book <em>Fulfillment: Winning and Losing in One-Click America</em>, Alec MacGillis fleshes out those reasons in a figurative sense as he chronicles real people caught in the cogs of the Amazon machine. The Atlantic has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/03/alec-macgillis-fulfillment-amazon/617796/\">a comprehensive piece</a> on the book. Before you get to the individual level, though, there are some startling statistics that the article provides. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon reaps fully half of what people in this country spend online.</li>\n<li>It is the second largest private employer in the US, behind Walmart.</li>\n<li>Amazon, along with Walmart, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of an arrangement that allows food stamps to be used for online groceries, bringing in large amounts of government money.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are more stats to be had (in the piece and elsewhere), but I don’t want to push the boundaries of fair use. These three points give you plenty upon which to ruminate, though. </p>\n\n<p>From a human interest perspective, MacGillis tells the stories of Amazon warehouse workers who face working conditions most of us would consider unfair, at the least. One worker he chronicles, who used to work at a Bethlehem Steel plant in Baltimore, ended up working at an Amazon warehouse on the same site for less than half the wages, at age 69, after the steel plant closed down. If nothing else, he enjoyed the continuity of working in the same place, until his supervisor threatened to dock his already meager pay over a bathroom break and he quit.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-3005\" id=\"fnr1-3005\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> Warehouse workers are not the only ones with problems getting bathroom time. It’s a particular problem with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation\">Amazon’s delivery drivers</a>, as well. Another worker MacGillis profiles stays in his basement at home, because of the high risk of COVID infection at the Amazon warehouse, so that he doesn’t put his family at risk. </p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://frostedechoes-test.micro.blog/uploads/2021/b7dc250e71.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>In pieces critical of Amazon, we are usually reminded that these stories are set amid the backdrop of the massive and inhuman wealth of former CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, who’s fortune is second only to that of Elon Musk. The contrasts could not be greater between the majority of the workers in the company and those at the very top. </p>\n\n<h2>It Used To Be Simpler</h2>\n\n<p>A few years ago, it was easy for me to feel like I was doing my duty as a conscientious consumer by avoiding Walmart. They were the big box bad guy putting smaller stores out of business and then hiring the employees for lower wages. They were the company employing many people part time to avoid giving them benefits. They were the ones forcing local companies to outsource labor in order to keep their products on store shelves.<sup><a href=\"#fn2-3005\" id=\"fnr2-3005\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> Walmart wore their thrift like a badge of honor, but the extremes to which they went to save money sucked the life out of the very areas where their customers lived. It wasn’t hard to wage a personal fight against the stingy retail giant, though, at least not in most metro areas. There were other places where the same goods could be had, even if they were to be had at a higher price. </p>\n\n<p>It’s more difficult to avoid Amazon than it was Walmart. With my health conditions, I need to get supplements I have a hard time finding elsewhere. I have both a Home Depot and a Lowe’s within a few miles of my house, but I still occasionally need to find home improvement items at Amazon. </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Walmart wore their thrift like a badge of honor, but the extremes to which they went to save money sucked the life out of the very areas where their customers lived.</h3>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Ebooks</h2>\n\n<p>There aren’t any true competitors to Amazon’s Kindle ebooks ecosystem. The closest one is Barnes and Noble’s Nook. It has been clear for quite some time that B&N isn’t really serious about their ebook readers, though. The last time I checked, you couldn’t even buy the latest version of their ereader, the GlowLight 3 on their website. When I had a Nook, there were significant software problems. For instance, sometimes turning the page caused it to skip dozens of pages and you would have to go back and find your spot. The system would crash fairly often. Besides the technical issues with the device, it was difficult for others to gift books to me. The company’s efforts in the area always felt half-baked, an afterthought adjunct to their actual business of selling paper. </p>\n\n<p>There are no other e-ink ebook readers, besides the Kindle, on which you can read books checked out from the library through the app Libby. This means if you have something like a Nook, you are even more locked in to the B&N ecosystem than you are Amazon’s ecosystem when you have a Kindle. Unfortunately, this is a problem that the Nook’s liberal sideloading abilities don’t solve. </p>\n\n<h2>Censorship</h2>\n\n<p>Much has been made recently about Amazon’s abrupt removal of the book <em>When Harry Became Sally</em> by Ryan T. Anderson. I haven’t read a sentence of this book (and since I mainly get books on my Kindle, it’s doubtful I will), but it was concerning that Amazon didn’t even follow their own policies when deciding to take the book off of their site. As Rob Vischer <a href=\"https://mirrorofjustice.blogs.com/mirrorofjustice/2021/03/thinking-clearly-about-cancel-culture.html\">points out on the Mirror of Justice blog </a>, this move, and others commonly attributed to “cancel culture,” wouldn’t be so concerning without the enormous clout that the big tech companies wield. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But what if Amazon decides to stop selling a controversial book? Amazon – like other Big Tech companies – doesn’t just participate in the market; in a real sense, they function as gatekeepers to the market. When those gatekeepers act to remove certain people or ideas from circulation, we should be concerned. (That doesn’t mean it should never happen – e.g., I don’t think Amazon should sell a do-it-yourself kit for building a dirty bomb at home.) In my view, the power of Big Tech is what makes today’s “cancel culture” debates relevant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Amazon as a business can decide what it does and does not want to sell. Vischer is right, though, that it is in the context of their market dominance that moves like this become concerning. </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>The spectacle of Bezos burning money for rocket fuel while people go without basics in this country is abhorrent, especially during a pandemic.</h3>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Space Billionaires</h2>\n\n<p>To come back briefly to the gap between worker and CEO pay, no company does a better job showcasing this than Amazon. Bezos may no longer be CEO, but he’s still the face of the franchise and his space voyages made on the backs of the overworked and underpaid do not go unnoticed. Bezos may have thanked Amazon workers, but his wave looked like it had a middle finger extended. The spectacle of Bezos burning money for rocket fuel while people go without basics in this country is abhorrent, especially during a pandemic. </p>\n\n\n<h2>The Challenge</h2>\n\n<p>I'm constantly asking myself: What is a conscientious consumer to do? Those who have disentangled themselves from the great ecommerce beast, please let me know the process you went through. <em>I'm open to even ways to partially extricate myself and feel good about contributing to a healthier retail, publishing and working environment.</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>Update: I'm going to have to absorb <a href=\"https://burk.io/2021/escaping-the-amazon\">this post</a> from Jason Burk, which details how he was able to make himself less dependent on Amazon.</em> </p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-3005\">\n<p>He had been peeing in the corner of the warehouse to avoid the strict bathroom time limits. <a href=\"#fnr1-3005\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-3005\">\n<p>Local textile company <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillowtex_Corporation\">Pillowtex was forced by Walmart to offshore their production</a> and close their local plants. <a href=\"#fnr2-3005\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

The Suicide Squad meanwhile may prove to be to the superhero movie what The Wild Bunch was to the western: a bloody, game-changing end to one phase, and the beginning of another, even richer one.\n\nI have no interest in seeing the Suicide Squad and frankly, it saddens me to see yet a new low in profanity and gore in superhero movies. I wonder when we'll reach the bottom. The author of the piece, Brogan Morris, seems to believe the new self-aware and perhaps even self-effacing superhero movie may bring more complexity along with the grit. I don't welcome this new phase but if it does, as Morris seems to believe, represent the last phase of superhero movies before the genre fades away, I can accept it as such. \n\nI have to question, though. _Is it even possible that we can get away from pure spectacle and back to more modest mid-budget movies again?_\n",

It’s the same music, but encountered in a much different way. The easy access that he enjoys to jump to anything in the sonic universe enables him to quickly make musical connections that it took me years to understand. The glut of information available in the internet can, in a short matter of time, fill a brain with enough musical trivia to shame the most learned and cynical 90’s hipster record store clerks. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>In the the space of a few days, my son went through Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. I thought, “it’s only a matter of time before he makes it to Dinosaur Jr.” Passing by his room a couple of days later, I heard the unmistakable bridge from the Dino Jr. song “Raisans.” The gruesome sample of a mentally ill man complaining that his bathing attendants were killing him is haunting every time I hear it. The sound of the guitar leads, erupting before you can even anticipate them, like lava from a long-dormant volcano, made their way into the hallway. </p>\n\n<p>Where he will leap to next I can't anticipate, although he has mentioned needing to hear Mudhoney as he takes in a grunge history lesson. With the wide availability of almost all recorded music a few taps on the keyboard away, he loses something that made crate digging and memorizing liner notes and record guides made special. In my teens, to a certain species of nerd, musical knowledge was power. When you were listening to Nirvana, The Smashing Pumpkins, Green Day and others a full two years before they broke into the mainstream and the jock with his locker next to yours suddenly became a fan, it gave you a sense that you were onto something. </p>\n\n<p>If you were not careful (not many teenagers are too careful), you could build up a sense of superiority over knowing what others would only come to find out later. It was easy to look down upon the johnny-come-lately crowd as mere posers. I shamefully remember the feeling of disdain. Once, in the twelfth grade, I had a fairly heated argument with one of my classmates in the library about what music was cool. A year later, she had died, a victim of a vicious asthma attack, and I laid in a hospital bed awaiting my first round of chemotherapy. After that point, I no longer had the will to make music a thing by which I judged others. It all seemed so pointless. </p>\n\n<p>I'm doing my penance now for my snobbery in high school, though. I couldn't stand Pearl Jam back then and now my teenage son listens to them more than any other band. He sings songs like &quot;Jeremy&quot; at the top of his lungs, so I hear them all of the time. <i>It serves me right.</i> </p>\n",

He found himself wondering about the sense, among the cast and crew of the movie, that the kind of teenage cruelty depicted would never fly today. In <a href=\"https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/at-the-heart-of-it-all?\">At the Heart of It All</a>, the writer, who never seems shy about openly discussing the more difficult aspects of life, argues that this type of cruelty among teenagers is not only still here, but will indeed never fully go away. </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But of course the world has not changed, not from the way things were in the 90s nor from the 70s, in most important ways. And one way that the world has not changed is that young people still treat each other with casual brutality that stems from the intense self-loathing that powers bullying, the awkwardness of our bodies and selves at that age, and the relentless jockeying for social rank endemic to high school. The vocabulary has changed, and there may be certain new kinds of plausible deniability built in to what were once more nakedly brutal practices. (More naked and thus more honest.) But I promise you that every single day high school students are absolutely savage to each other. What’s more, human nature being what it is, I’m sure that they now do so explicitly utilizing the politicized and therapeutic language that proponents of social justice norms foolishly assume is an antidote to that bad behavior. Because interpersonal cruelty is a universal aspect of the human condition and any philosophy can be bent to its use. This condition can perhaps at times be ameliorated but it can never be eliminated and learning this reality is an important part of growing up. Cruelty is here to stay.</p>\n\n<p>What today’s social justice politics ask for is a world that’s nice, a world that’s safe for everyone all the time. And of course this is impossible. The nice world is never coming. Yes, we need to work to make the world a more equitable and humane place. There are certain areas in that domain where progress is possible. But to say, as many now do, that we need to eliminate bullying, or even eliminate microaggressions, is no less fantastical than saying we need to build spaceships to take us away from this fallen earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't know where deBoer stands on religion. His take on human nature, though, seems to borrow from the Christian tradition. His specific use of the word &quot;fallen,&quot; that references (whether intentionally or not), the first story of the book of Genesis, commonly referred to as &quot;the Fall.&quot; In Christian writing, we are frequently grappling with how to live our faith in a fallen world. To be more specific, though, deBoer almost sounds Calvinist.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-7205\" id=\"fnr1-7205\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> He relays a strong skepticism that we can ever enact enough positive conditioning or even societal shaming mechanisms to eliminate the base tendencies of humanity. In Christianity, this is where unmerited grace comes in. </p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, deBoer's stance on human tendencies and the modern desire to rewire them matches the take on modernity <a href=\"https://blogs.ancientfaith.com/glory2godforallthings/2021/05/11/make-it-so-vs-let-it-be/\">that comes from</a> Orthodox priest Fr. Stephen Freeman. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Again, that reception is not purely passive. We use what we receive. We invent, we improve. We enjoy. However, doing those things with a heart that gratefully receives what has been given, and that seeks to know and understand the nature of that gift, is vastly different than the various arrogant modernisms of “making the world a better place,” and “re-inventing human beings.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Along with Freeman's sense of gratitude comes a pessimism about how much humanity can be changed through systematic means. “People are people,” as the Depeche Mode song goes. Or “boys will be boys” as one bully’s father said when his son was picking on my brother. In some ways, we recognize that human nature stays the same across the generations. </p>\n\n<p>We shouldn't resign ourselves to tolerance of cruelty, though. From a Christian perspective, we are called to help bring about God’s kingdom “on earth, as it is in heaven.”<sup><a href=\"#fn2-7205\" id=\"fnr2-7205\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> We may not always be perfect in our attempts. We may fall short. We may even find ourselves disheartened that we can never be fully successful. Jesus, after all, reminded us that &quot;the poor you will always have with you.&quot;<sup><a href=\"#fn3-7205\" id=\"fnr3-7205\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> He also expected that we tend to the poor and try and alleviate conditions of inequity, though. I understand where the deBoer and Freeman are coming from, because many many contemporary attempts to fix the problems of social interaction tend to go too far past the mark. Even so, I want us to recognize that acknowledgment and acceptance are two different things. </p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-7205\">\n<p>One could imagine deBoer referencing the doctrine of total depravity.  <a href=\"#fnr1-7205\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-7205\">\n<p>Matthew 6:10 <a href=\"#fnr2-7205\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn3-7205\">\n<p>Matthew 26:11 <a href=\"#fnr3-7205\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

She is angry about the defunding of the publication she had put her heart into, and wants others to know it. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Cords is tired of the churn in journalism and the constant desire of technology companies to be \"disruptive.\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But you know what?

So much so that it’s considered an act of rebellion for a song to have a standard verse, chorus, verse format. Or, as in the case, that Alan Jacobs <a href=\"https://blog.ayjay.org/bits-and-pieces/\">writes about</a>, a slow intro that gives way to something with hooks. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every summer needs a song, and pretty obviously this is the one for 2021. One note: it’s significant that Lake Street Dive has been around for about a decade and is very much an indie band. How can you tell? Because the song begins with a slow intro before kicking into that irresistible groove. A song calculated to maximize streaming-service revenue would never do that: because Spotify only pays artists for listens of 30 seconds or more, studios are forcing their songwriters to frontload their songs’ choruses. “Hypotheticals” as a composition is a relic of the past; we’ll get fewer and fewer songs structured that way. Another reason — along with that sweet groove and Rachael Price’s amazing voice — to appreciate a terrific pop-R&amp;B throwback number.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When you think about it, artists have always tailored their songs to certain mediums, to some extent. If a song wasn’t short enough for radio, for example, with “The Diamond Sea” by Sonic Youth, clocking out at just under 20 minutes, the band made a radio-friendly edit. More frequently, the constraints of the medium were built into the creation of the song. However, this payment structure that Spotify has introduced puts the artist in a very small box in which to write a song. It’s another way Spotify is changing the musical landscape, and in this case, not for the better. </p>\n",

He simply edited his expectations to accord with his new reality and sought to find his joy there, within these new <strong>parameters of being.</strong> (<em>emphasis mine</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Whitman, an unabashed lover of nature, lost much of the freedom that had been afforded him to enjoy it, after his stroke at the age of 53. He was forced to move from his home in Washington to live with his brother in New Jersey. Although he regained some of his abilities over time, the event changed his perspective and allowed him to see continue to see meaning and purpose even within the constraints he was given. I like the phrase “parameters of being” as it implies the life that must be lived within those constraints. </p>\n",

It was countercultural for her to include Arha, a young priestess, as the main character. She discusses this in the more recently written afterward to the book. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>These days there are plenty, though I wonder about some of them. The women warriors of current fantasy epics—ruthless swordswomen with no domestic or sexual responsibility who gallop about slaughtering baddies—to me they look less like women than like boys in women’s bodies in men’s armor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To her point, I found, when looking for a fantasy novel to read, that many of the recent ones have female protagonists. They are almost always described as “strong female leads” and sometimes (though not always) meet the description that Le Guin gives. It seems requisite that any women who are main characters in fantasy books can be described as tough. The reviews of these books reap praise on them for having female characters that meet certain criteria. </p>\n\n<p>Le Guin took a more nuanced approach to developing her characters, one that saw the importance of elevating strong women but not overcorrecting for the centuries of neglect. One that considered both men and women in their totality, fleshing them out in three dimensions. She also conceptualized the relationship between men and women in a different way than is typical now. </p>\n\n<p>In contrast to the contemporary idea that life is a zero sum game in which for one gender to thrive, the other has to wither, Le Guin imagines them in complement.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-1244\" id=\"fnr1-1244\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> Men and women are better together, cooperating for mutual benefit. This doesn’t have to mean a proscription of roles, but it does mean an acknowledgement of interdependence. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some people have read the story as supporting the idea that a woman needs a man in order to do anything at all (some nodded approvingly, others growled and hissed). Certainly Arha/Tenar would better satisfy feminist idealists if she did everything all by herself. But the truth as I saw it, and as I established it in the novel, was that she couldn’t. My imagination wouldn’t provide a scenario where she could, because my heart told me incontrovertibly that neither gender could go far without the other. So, in my story, neither the woman nor the man can get free without the other. Not in that trap. Each has to ask for the other’s help and learn to trust and depend on the other. A large lesson, a new knowledge for both these strong, willful, lonely souls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This was radical at the time it was written and is probably even more radical now. </p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-1244\">\n<p>I know the term “complement“ can be loaded in this context with all sorts of cultural baggage, but I assure you I bring none of that with it. <a href=\"#fnr1-1244\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

He’s sloppy, which is part of who he is, or his brand, if you will. As one music critic once said of his cover of the Cure’s “Just Like Heaven,” when he says, “‘I must have been asleep for days,’ you really believe him.” A recently released live album actually has him singing “blah, blah, blah,” on one of the songs when he forgets the words. Though he’s a much revered guitar player, his acoustic guitar playing is rough on live recordings.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>When Nick O’Keefe covers “Little Fury Things,” he is more precise. He does the song (one of my all-time favorites and maybe the best album-opener) justice with a straight take on the Dino Jr. classic.

Especially the beginning of hypnosis, called induction, which is designed to put you into a state of relaxation in which you are more susceptible to suggestion. The watching of the breath, the attention on sensations in the body that focus and settle your mind are integral to both beginning hypnosis and to mindfulness meditation. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>When Cassandra Jenkins begins the song “Hard Drive” with spoken word, it feels like a hypnotic induction. With the saxophones playfully decorating the background, the accompanying instruments sound a bit like something off the Blue Nile’s <em>Hats</em> LP. Jenkins transitions to a singing voice as the chorus starts and it sounds all the more beautiful for the contrast with the spoken narrative. The song is masterfully constructed. As Jenkins speaks towards the end of the track, she narrates a friend assuring her of a better future, then slowly counting to three while directing deep breathing, which mimics the part of cuing someone out of hypnosis. </p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>{{< youtube eW8XoovSlsM >}}</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>Jenkins talks about therapy in the song.

It doesn’t carry the risk of social media (particularly Twitter). It allows for editing even after a post is originally published. I was happy to read that I’m not the only one that goes back and edits my blog posts several times after they are published. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Being wrong publicly is the easiest way to learn what you need to know. The trouble is: it’s also the easiest way to get yelled at or shamed or “canceled,” as they say.</p>\n\n<p>To do the exploration that growth and change requires, one needs a forgiving medium… but what one really needs forgiving readers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A few years ago, when I published a <em>Frosted Echoes</em> as a newsletter, one of the things that frustrated me most was catching an error after I had sent out the email. It was almost impossible to avoid, no matter how many times my eyes scanned over the text. It feels much more comfortable to post a blog post and have the ability to correct mistakes after the initial publish. The social piece of Micro.blog even allows you to edit responses to people, once they have been posted.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-9071\" id=\"fnr1-9071\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> </p>\n\n<p>What Kleon gets at here, though, is the ability to correct not a spelling or grammar mistake, but something you may have been wrong about. A chance to change your mind. It’s being active on a public platform that allows for a modicum of grace. </p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-9071\">\n<p>Editing tweets is something people have long been asking for from Twitter. <a href=\"#fnr1-9071\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

However, he continues to work with The Verge in some capacity, and they just published <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22349175/medium-layoffs-union-evan-williams-blogger-twitter-subscription\">his piece on problems at Medium.com</a>. As most have come to expect, Medium is doing yet another pivot in their strategy and is letting go a large chunk of their editorial staff, admitting that their rapid ramp up of publications had been too aggressive. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>From Ev Williams’ email about the change to employees, which he published <a href=\"https://link.medium.com/8HjPpP8ZUeb\">on his blog</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whether this strategy works or not, here’s what I know is certain: There will be more change in the future. I don’t want to shy away from this reality, as I consider embracing change one of our biggest strengths.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anecdotally, to a person, everyone I have encountered considers change to be Medium’s biggest weakness. You can’t count on them to stick with any given strategy. While their current (until this week) business model was fairly successful, it apparently was not enough. From Newton’s piece:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Medium entered the year with more than 700,000 paid subscriptions, putting it on track for more than $35 million in revenue, according to two people familiar with the matter. That’s a healthy sum for a media company. But it represents a weak outcome for Williams, who previously sold Blogger to Google and co-founded Twitter, which eventually went public and today has a market capitalization of more than $50 billion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I saw figures a few months ago detailing subscriber growth, I thought Medium would now be on a stable path. The figures were correct, but I overestimated the tolerance for slower growth and ability to let the model mature. When <a href=\"https://frostedechoes.com/2020/11/18/medium-admiring-rss.html\">I wrote a post about the new strategy</a>, the response I received was one of skepticism about their latest pivot. I understood that reaction, but hoped that the positive results they had seen would stabilize things. </p>\n\n<p>The recently <a href=\"https://link.medium.com/8uTeVPb2Ueb\">renewed ability to use your own domain name</a> on a publication or on your individual blog further convinced me that Medium was headed in the right direction. Now I’m unsure again. There isn’t much risk in blogging on Medium, if you do use your own domain. If needed, you can export your posts as HTML. Moving off the platform would be pretty easy. There is reason for pause, though. How much would you want to invest in a company that, after almost a decade, still can’t decide what they want to be when they grow up? </p>\n",

Like surgeon Dr. Sam Parnia, who has also studied this area thoroughly, Greyson has come up with no verifiable or satisfying scientific ways of explaining the extraordinary things people go through when they are on the precipice of death. </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>One of the things I’ve found most interesting about those who have undergone these experiences is their transformative nature. This one single experience has a dramatic effect on how people live the rest of their lives. I’ve read about people coming back so changed that they get divorced because they are so different from the person that married their spouse.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Greyson sometimes asks people to describe their partners before and after an event, “and they’ll say, ‘Yeah, this isn’t the person I married; this is someone different.’” He adds, “They see a purpose in life they didn’t see before. I don’t know of anything else that powerful.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Greyson says that he is recognizing now that there is more to us than our physical selves. He says that the mind may be distinct from the brain. Call it the psyche, or the soul, there is an acknowledgement of consciousness outside our material presence. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I grew up without any kind of a spiritual background,” he continues. “And I’m still not sure I understand what spiritual means. I am convinced now, after doing this for 40, 50 years, that there is more to life than just our physical bodies. I recognise that there is a non-physical part of us. Is that spiritual? I’m not sure. Spirituality usually involves a search for something greater than yourself, for meaning and purpose in the universe. Well, I certainly have that.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>Greyson has a book on the subject out now called <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781250263032\">After</a>.</em></p>\n",

He believes that an extra episode that deals with their trauma would be appropriate. In the piece, he discusses the unreliability of Wanda as a narrator with regards to whether she knows what her spell is inflicting upon the citizens of Westview. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some may point to those scenes where Wanda tells Vision that she has no idea what’s happening, or how it’s happening, as a way to let her off the hook. However, WandaVision sets up Wanda as something of an unreliable narrator, especially when we see her increasingly desperate attempts maintain the illusion and prevent others, including her own husband, from uncovering it. Still others may point out that when Wanda discovers the effects of her illusion, she does lift it so that Westview’s citizens can escape — only to put it back in place the minute she sees that Vision and their two sons are being adversely effected.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s really not clear, at different points in the show, what Wanda knows about the pain that the citizens of the town are going through (or whether she wants to know). It also isn’t clear how interested the story is in putting a focus on that. To use the military term, the town residents are almost treated as collateral damage. Even after understanding the difficulty that the citizens have gone through, one of the protagonists, Monica Rambeau, admits that she would have done the same thing, under the spell of grief. </p>\n\n<p>Morehead brings up <em>Age of Ultron</em> as a counter-example of this in the MCU. My wife and I watched that movie a couple of weeks ago so she could see the back story on the twins and had the exact opposite reaction. There’s so much widescreen destruction and ‘splosions everywhere, that you can easily get distracted from the people caught in the middle of the firefights. The mechanisms of telling these stories about superheroes handle most of the ordinary humans with the same capriciousness that the Greek gods were said to have handled mortals in their tales. Certain people are depicted as being saved like precious jewels while others are fodder for the Ultron stormtrooper armies. </p>\n\n<p>I don’t know how to resolve this issue. In these smash ‘em ups, the buildings, the cars (oh my gosh, the cars) and the people ancillary to the story all serve as props for spectacle. A huge boss fight in a city doesn’t work without the stage setup (which includes the unfortunate denizens of the area under siege). I think the difference between <I>WandaVision</I> and the other MCU vehicles was that we did get to understand more about the people on the sidelines and that brought more attention to their plight. This makes us feel like they are deserving of additional care. </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>The mechanisms of telling these stories about superheroes handle most of the ordinary humans with the same capriciousness that the Greek gods were said to have handled mortals in their tales.</h3>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>In a certain way, the model that <I>WandaVision</I> brings with it, where the audience is given a chance to emote with the people on the periphery of the main action, is a step in the right direction for the MCU. It’s something I haven’t seen as much of, to this point.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-22470\" id=\"fnr1-22470\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> I think it could be considered another way that the show breaks barriers within the genre. </p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-22470\">\n<p>I don’t claim to have seen every Marvel film or tv show. <a href=\"#fnr1-22470\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

That is, Catholicism and “dark” rock subcultures alike fill the yearning that some people have for incense, dripping candles, archaic flourishes, and pompous spectacles of commanding men in outrageous costumes. In the parts of Europe where, in the 16th century, Martin Luther imposed a form of Christian faith that is the religious equivalent of Brian Eno or Kraftwerk, it is not surprising that an opposite musical culture flourishes in parallel that lets it all hang out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s easy to come to the conclusion that you can’t completely satisfy the spiritual needs of a broad spectrum of people with either a high or a low church option. There are people who need to engage with the divine through the sense of reverence that is invoked by the sights, smells and sounds of a Catholic or Orthodox Church. Then there are those for whom those things may even impede their communion with the almighty and prefer the more direct and personal approach.

There was a certain purity to that movie, with Reeve’s “aw shucks” Clark Kent and “never touch the stuff” Superman. It will be interesting to see if the new stories can keep that same sort of innocence or whether they give in to the cynicism that permeates our current age. </p>\n\n<p>These movies were my formative cinematic superhero experiences, and I heartily welcome a trip back into their respective universes.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-8686\">\n<p>Sorry Prince, even if I could find my Batman soundtrack tape and a working cassette player, those songs did nothing to augment the movie for me. <a href=\"#fnr1-8686\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

This is usually cited as their main reason for supporting the former president, despite the fact that he possessed almost every character trait they had vocally opposed in past leaders. Beyond supporting the president, they have appeared, at times, to almost want to <a href=\"https://frostedechoes.com/2020/01/10/we-demand-a.html\">make him their king</a>. </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Attitudes among evangelicals are shifting on a number of topics. NPR reporter Tom Gjelton from “Morning Edition” <a href=\"https://text.npr.org/966498544\">cites a disturbing new survey</a> that shows a number of Americans consider violence a legitimate political tool to achieve their desired outcomes. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The survey found that nearly three in 10 Americans, including 39% of Republicans, agreed that, “If elected leaders will not protect America, the people must do it themselves, even if it requires violent actions.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What should be most shocking about the appetite for violent action is that much of it is coming from those who consider themselves Christians.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The AEI survey found that partisan divisions were also evident along religious lines. About three in five white evangelicals told the pollsters that Biden was not legitimately elected, that it was not accurate to say former President Donald Trump encouraged the attack on the Capitol, and that a Biden presidency now has them feeling disappointed, angry or frightened.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s important to remember that the term evangelical means to evangelize, or seek to convert someone to Christianity. Who is going to be convinced that a Christian holds the key to ultimate truth when they can’t even accept the obvious truths in front of them?<sup><a href=\"#fn1-28131\" id=\"fnr1-28131\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> If someone feeding them a narrative that is counter to the facts so easily sways them, what does that say of their witness?</p>\n\n<p>I don’t want to be dismissive of fears of anti-Christian bias, though I have yet to see evidence of a systemic problem in the US. I do think that some US Christians have developed a sense of persecution beyond what is warranted, particularly when drawn in comparison to the persecutions in other countries and those that are set in the cement of history. The fact that a practicing Catholic in the White House has them so distressed is evidence of their relative safety and outsized concern with regard to religious issues. Do people really believe that Joe from Scranton is going to mark the end of Christianity in America? </p>\n\n<p>As a thought exercise, let’s imagine that Christians are facing a difficult climate in the US, with secularism dominating the systems of power. How does scripture command us to respond? I think <a href=\"https://blog.ayjay.org/your-periodic-friendly-reminder-of-a-very-inconvenient-truth/\">this piece</a> from Alan Jacobs, which touches on themes he has written about before, adds some clarity here (emphasis mine). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do people twist the truth or simply lie about us? Are we treated with subtle and not-so-subtle bigotry? Are we mocked and belittled? Might we, soon enough, be facing actual persecution? If so, then we have our instructions:</p>\n\n<p><strong>We are to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>If people take our coats we should give them our cloaks as well.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We should never return evil for evil, but should strive to live at peace with everyone.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If these seem like difficult objectives, it might be helpful to study the history of the ancient Christians and the evidence of their fidelity to these teachings. The book <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/1481304747\">Destroyer of the Gods</a> by Larry W. Hurtado proves especially instructional here, as it accounts the early Christians, what made them distinctive, and what put them at odds with their neighbors.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>I do think that some US Christians have developed a sense of persecution beyond what is warranted, particularly when drawn in comparison to the persecutions in other countries and those that are set in the cement of history.</h3>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Ancient Christians were put to death by the Roman Empire for their faith. They were martyred for being “obstinate,” in the translated words of the much venerated (even now) stoic philosopher and Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelias, and refusing to worship the Roman Emperor. Nevertheless, in the face of violence, they did not return in kind. They held fast to the words of Jesus (and Paul) that were cited by Professor Jacobs above. </p>\n\n<p>What would it look like for American Christians to follow the words of Christ as they speak to enduring hostility with grace?</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-28131\">\n<p>In this case, that Joe Biden was legitimately elected. <a href=\"#fnr1-28131\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

Though I would expect as much from an independent musician like Krukowski, the piece is not exactly kind to Spotify. Although they are not one of my favorites, Galaxy 500, of which he was a part, are one of the most influential bands of their generation. I would guess all their streams on Spotify have netted them a meager sum. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>What comes out most profoundly in this piece is the difference in the missions of the two services and how they characterize their businesses. </p>\n\n<p>From Bandcamp CEO Ethan Diamond:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“There's this great story – there was a New Yorker article about it – about how Prince was working on his autobiography just before he died. And he had picked a co-writer and in one of their initial meetings together he said, 'Music is healing. Write that down first.' He said that he wanted it to be the guiding principle they used in the book. And if you start with this idea that music is healing, that is obviously a power that should be in the hands of everybody who has the talent to wield it. ... And so that's what Bandcamp is. That's what I feel like we're here to build – that system. And the way you do that is by ensuring that artists are compensated fairly and transparently for their work. And that is through the direct support of their fans.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On Daniel Ek, and the Spotify business model, which sounds a lot like the Netflix business model: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Spotify is not a &quot;music company first,&quot; as Diamond describes Bandcamp, because music plays a role only insofar as people spend some of their time listening to it, and Spotify wants all their time. What truly comes first for Spotify is competition – the company is focused on eliminating other places for time spent listening to... whatever. If it's to conspiracist shock jock Joe Rogan – now signed to Spotify for exclusivity of his podcast, reportedly for upwards of $100 million – then it's Joe Rogan. And Joe Rogan is anything but healing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

The technologist, Kevin Kelly, a cofounder of Wired magazine, went to interview the Luddite, Kirkpatrick Sale, at his apartment. The interview was a pretext for Kelly to challenge Sale to a bet about the future of a society influenced by the rapid gains in computing technology. </p>\n\n<p>Kelly had a strong belief that society would benefit tremendously from advances in computing. His career was defined by that belief. Sale predicted nothing less than a societal collapse. He had been advocating for a return to preindustrial life for decades. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even back then, Sale distrusted computers. With another classmate, he cowrote a sci-fi musical about escaping a dystopian America ruled by IBM; it features an evil computer. If this sounds at all Pynchonesque, it’s probably because Sale’s cowriter was Thomas Pynchon.

I mostly focus on blogging. This year, I experimented with the new blogging options on the Medium platform. I like them a lot. The ability to create shorter posts within your timeline is a game changer. The new customization options let your make your blog more personal. Combined with the great support Medium has for embeds through Embedly, the service feels a bit like Tumblr for adults. It's a nice set of tools. Unfortunately, it's still Medium. It thrives on social media staples such as likes (claps) and followers. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>It didn’t take me too long to remember that the applause economy on Medium is not for me. Nor is the follower count, displayed prominently on your blog as a sort of status symbol. I syndicate my personal blog posts to Medium and consequently I tend to pick up about one follower a week. Some of them seem like they are trying to sell something. One recent follower has a bio that claims he is passionate about writing, but his body of work is nonexistent. Jack Baty succinctly summed up the dynamic that Medium fosters.</p> \n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" data-title=\"\" data-author=\"Jack Baty\" data-avatar=\"https://micro.blog/jack/avatar.jpg\" cite=\"https://micro.baty.net/2021/01/16/the-problem-with.html\"><p>The problem with Medium is that it’s full of people for whom being read is more important than writing.</p><footer>Jack Baty <cite><a href=\"https://micro.baty.net/2021/01/16/the-problem-with.html\">https://micro.baty.net/2021/01/16/the-problem-with.html</a></cite></footer></blockquote><script src=\"https://micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n\n<p>A response to Baty’s original thought from Pratik further clarifies the feeling I get when I’m on Medium.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" data-title=\"\" data-author=\"Pratik\" data-avatar=\"https://micro.blog/pratik/avatar.jpg\" cite=\"https://micro.blog/pratik/10870268\"><p><a href=\"https://micro.blog/jack\">[@jack](https://micro.blog/jack)</a> This is 💯 Lot of posts I read on there sometimes are trying too hard.

The focus on monetizing your writing all but ensures the platform will continue down this path. This is not good for recreational bloggers. <a href=\"https://www.spring.org.uk/2009/10/how-rewards-can-backfire-and-reduce-motivation.php\">Studies have shown</a> that paying people to do something reduces their intrinsic motivation to do it. </p>\n\n<p>While the network effects of Medium may be valuable to those who do want to build an audience and make money from it, they don’t seem to be especially beneficial to the casual blogger. This is a shame, because the features that they built this past year make writing and publishing easy and fun. </p>\n",

Working at a software company, I have been involved with our legal representatives in crafting terms of service, and never have I heard a question come up about our ability to enforce said terms. However, with social media, this seems to be coming up fairly often these days. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>It reminds me of when, a few years ago, Wayne Coyne from the Flaming Lips kept posting nudes on Instagram. Since this violated their terms of service, they would suspend his account and take down his photos. He would sort of complain about this, feign ignorance, then start up a new account and start posting nudes again. His fans would be incensed by Instagram’s enforcement of their terms. Their sense of indignation about Coyne being entitled to violate Instagram’s terms of service seemed to imply that he was either the owner, or partner, or at the very least a paying customer. In reality, he was none of those things. Increasingly, people who publish on big social media networks seem to feel that a space on those networks belongs to them, and they are free to use whatever editorial discretion they see fit. </p>\n\n<p>If an artist, like Coyne, wanted to display his artwork in a gallery, the gallery would have to agree to that artwork being displayed in their space. Even if, hypothetically, the gallery were to have an open exhibition and allow anyone to show their art, there would likely be rules about what could be displayed. If those rules were violated, the gallery would then have the right to take down the artwork. The gallery belongs to its owner, and they manage the infrastructure, rent/mortgage, utilities, upkeep and more. In the case of Instagram (which I’ll stick to, for purposes of the analogy), they pay for the R&D, support, infrastructure, monitoring, etc.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-20131\" id=\"fnr1-20131\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> Therefore, they have every right to determine what appears on the service for which they are then responsible.</p>\n\n<p>The argument for unrestricted rights to post anything on social media seems to stem from a belief that, once a service reaches a certain critical mass, it becomes a property of the people. After all, no one is arguing that Micro.blog doesn’t have a right to their stringent community standards.<sup><a href=\"#fn2-20131\" id=\"fnr2-20131\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> The people who run the service <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/2017/community-guidelines/\">are very open</a> about how members of the community have to behave. Are having those community guidelines a violation of free speech? Not at all. Those who create and maintain a service have the right to decide what is permissible on that service, regardless of the size of the service and how many members it may attract. </p>\n\n<p>As M.G. Siegler <a href=\"https://500ish.com/free-as-in-twitter-d7fd577971ce\">put it</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Twitter is a private enterprise. They can set their own rules for what they want or do not want on their service. Including whom they want or do not want on their service. Full stop.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve expended a few words to get to the same point, but it’s really that simple. </p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-20131\">\n<p>Although, less of the “R” part when they just steal features from other platforms. <a href=\"#fnr1-20131\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-20131\">\n<p>Even people who are using the Micro.blog service who are making the argument that Twitter shouldn’t be able to enforce its standards. <a href=\"#fnr2-20131\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

I put together the playlist, throughout the month, pulling tracks from my New Music list on Apple Music, my favorite music blogs and sometimes even rereleases of classic material. As Jason Morehead <a href=\"https://opuszine.us/posts/my-favorite-songs-2019\">wrote of 2019</a>, I always worry that I’m not going to find the same amount of good music as I did in the previous year. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s a silly, completely irrational thought: Shortly after the new year begins, I despair that I’ll find any new music that was as good, beautiful, or evocative as the music I discovered in the previous year. And I’m always wrong. By the year’s end, I’m struck by the amount of incredible music that I’ve heard over the past twelve months, and 2019 was no different.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since I do my playlists each month, though, I have that feeling at the start of almost every month. To be fair, some months do end up being a little dry, but as Morehead also experiences, by the end of the year, I’ve got a treasure trove of songs.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of 2020, I decided to put together a playlist of the new songs I liked best from my 12 playlists. For me, one of the most satisfying aspects of putting together a playlist is sequencing the tracks in a way that makes sense and flows. This year started out with material that worked well in a linear progression. The dreaminess of the Pet Shop Boys’ “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n60bVZt2tc\">Only The Dark</a>” is perfectly followed by the nighttime drive soundtrack that is Destroyer’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmApPGE6Zio\">It Just Doesn’t Happen</a>.” The breathy vocals in Cigarettes After Sex’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LmzF7-8flk\">Heavenly</a>” make an appropriate prelude to the low-key noir cover of Paramore’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMBKc5Kp3s8\">All I Wanted</a>,” performed by Bathe Alone. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, as I reflect on the previous year’s musical contributions, I have to start on my January 2021 playlist. Will things start running dry this year? Will the pandemic break the pattern of consistently fresh new songs? </p>\n\n<p>Only time will tell, but I’m hopeful that musicians will continue to find a way to make things work. </p>\n",

I have a hard time imagining asking for intercessory prayers from a saint, but a Catholic friend once put it to me as being like asking a friend to pray for you. I have to admit that made some sense, though I still don’t know about veneration.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>It seems like reminders of the great cloud of witnesses are more important than ever. This past year has been disruptive to religious and political beliefs alike. Aarik Danielsen touches on this in his piece <a href=\"https://christandpopculture.com/blessed-are-the-weary-for-they-will-find-rest/\">Blessed Are the Weary, for They Will Find Rest</a> for Christ and Pop Culture.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This year keeps revealing deep fissures in the foundations where we once built assurance. The communion of saints, interrupted by conspiracy theories fellow Christians promote online. Our cloud of witnesses turn their faces from us. Even our textbook teachings on democracy have been ripped to confetti.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The example of the saints might be what we need, at this moment in time. Their steady posture, not swaying the least in the gusts of any political wind. </p>\n",

A simple title to a record label compilation, but a more accurate descriptor could not have been employed. <em>Beautiful Noise</em> from Sunday Records is just that, slices of mostly synthetic instrumental dream pop that are as ethereal and gorgeous as any your imagination could conjure. Almost every song is uniquely transportational, taking the listener to a different liminal space, but the pervading aesthetic fuses the parts together as a magnificent whole. By the time the drums pads hit on the second track, “Million Years” by Mariana In Our Heads, you will likely be someplace else entirely.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>The Bandcamp page for the compilation describes its conception. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are too few genuine musical labours of love out there, but it's clear this is one. It seems fitting it was a project first dreamt up by Sunday Records boss, Albert, right back at the beginning of the label in the early 90s and here it finally comes to fruition. As well as cd and download the existence of a cassette may feel like a hipster affectation but actually fits for what feels like a lovingly put together old school mixtape, if only it came in a hand crayoned cover..</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some of these bands don’t even have full length albums out. Hopefully this little collection will whet your appetite for more from the contributors, in the future, as we close out this wretched year. </p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2604526358/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"https://sundayrecords.bandcamp.com/album/beautiful-noise\">Beautiful Noise by Sunday Records</a></iframe> </p>\n",

For the most part, we are talking about businesses that are ultimately beholden to making money for their shareholders. If doing the right thing is no longer popular, will we see their altruism wither? The government in a democracy, by contrast, is ultimately accountable to the people that put it in power, and thus should always theoretically be doing the right thing for those constituents. We can’t keep expecting private industry or benevolent individuals to pick up the slack where our government is letting us down. This is an area in which it is in our power to demand more from those we elect.</p>\n",

He is using vinyl as a reference for older traditions that are slower and more thought out. Vinyl churches don’t try so hard to be accessible to the younger generation. </p>\n<!--more-->\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the sooner we stop watering things down and trying to make church ‘hip’ or ‘relevant’, the more we can get closer to authenticity. Dust off that old turntable, dear church. Leave the skinny jeans in the drawer and put those vestments back on. Take the projectors, strobe lights, and fog machines down and bring in the thuribles and incense (the more the better). Tell your praise band to save the rock and roll for real rock and roll and bring in old hymns (maybe comb through the toxic theology), the organ, and/or a choir. Contemporary music is excusable in elevators and shopping malls, but not vinyl church.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m happy to be a member of what he describes as a vinyl church. We sing the old hymns, and though some of the less popular ones are pretty hard to sing, it’s nice to feel like a part of a tradition. When I see blog posts with titles like, “What We Lost When We Lost Our Hymnals,” I can’t relate. </p>\n\n<p>This piece reminds me of something Rachel Held Evans wrote a few years ago, that I responded to <a href=\"https://frostedechoes.medium.com/i-love-the-recent-piece-about-how-churches-don-t-need-to-try-to-be-cool-to-attract-millenials-by-4e3fd148f7fa\">in this post</a>. I love the vinyl metaphor, though, especially in light of the recent surge in vinyl sales, which have eclipsed CD sales for the first time in decades. The metaphor brings with it a focus on the intentional. It also works well with the conversation about the imperfections in vinyl. Churches bear those same imperfections. Someone once tried to tell John Peel that CD’s were better than vinyl because they don’t have surface noise. He responded, “Listen mate, life has surface noise.” The same can be said of the church. </p>\n",

Genre is an identifier, important in pointing the way and gluing together scenes. There was a time that you could walk into an indie record store, look at the clientele, and guess what genres they listened to by how they looked. It's harder now that genres are less-defined and blur together — which I'll argue is a good thing. But it's also why genres are reaching beyond sonic vibes and sounds, increasingly representative of technological innovation, communities, and desired lifestyles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He points out the utility of categorizing new music in a way that will bring the listener in. Not only does it engage the listener, but it helps the musician to identify their output as their own piece of a larger movement. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Consider the genre as an elevator pitch. It's a chance to claim a plot of land and plant a flag.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered where we get genre names like blue grass, free jazz (that one I actually knew), reggae, techno, industrial, or new wave (that one has to do with CBGB’s), Donaldson has you covered with some musical trivia facts. He even goes on to address some of the controversy surrounding the naming of the “world music” genre. This is a highly enjoyable stroll through the fragmented state of music this days. We don't have to lament the many new branches of this sonic tree. We can learn to love the different fruits that can be plucked from them. </p>\n",

He travels lightly and made short work of the move. I wish I could say I would be able to do the same, but it would take me a while to move all of my stuff.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-28640\" id=\"fnr1-28640\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> I wondered aloud about the difficulty of moving my record collection. Another coworker said “one man’s treasure is another man’s trash,” inverting the old aphorism. I stared at my records filling the bottom four cubes of my IKEA Kallax shelves. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>I’ve had trouble with the idea of collecting things in the past few years. Part of it goes back to the words of Jesus in the book of Matthew:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Stop collecting treasures for your own benefit on earth, where moth and rust eat them and where thieves break in and steal them. Instead, collect treasures for yourselves in heaven, where moth and rust don’t eat them and where thieves don’t break in and steal them. Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” (Matthew 6:19-21, CEB)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can’t help but feel like whatever I have shouldn’t mean that much to me, anyway. What will happen to these objects when I pass? As the old saying goes, you can’t take it with you. I think about my record collection potentially being something my kids have to figure out a way to get rid of, once I’m gone. Then again, maybe they won’t feel like getting rid of them.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate <a href=\"https://kottke.org/20/11/one-thing-leads-to-another\">this post</a> about collecting from Jason Kottke. In particular, his closing comment stuck with me. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have never been much of a collector, but my 22+ years of efforts on this site (collecting knowledge/links?) and my sharing of photos on Flickr/Instagram over the years definitely have resulted in some of the same benefits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I like this idea of what we collect being less material.

The discussion was prompted by the recent death of Sean Connery, who starred in the film alongside Michael Caine. I first saw the movie when my 12th grade English teacher showed it to the class and loved it immediately. </p>\n\n<p>Both of the hosts liked the film, but didn’t seem to view it as an undeniable classic like I do. One of the things they believe is a major weakness is in the absolute othering of the people of Kafiristan, whom the British ex-soldiers that Connery and Caine play, are trying to rule. They are certainly right that these people are othered to the point of being almost faceless and unrepresented. However, I think that’s part of the point of the film. These are people that Europeans thought so inferior that they don’t even see them as individuals capable of agency and certainly not self-government.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-2902\" id=\"fnr1-2902\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> The film shows the danger of that attitude and how that sense of superiority can be destructive. In fact, that seems to be the main message of the movie. To that end, the othering of the people in the film serves to show us things through the eyes of the two British men and helps us to share in their ultimate lesson. </p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-2902\">\n<p>I just finished reading <em>A Passage to India</em> and this comes out heavily in that work, as well. <a href=\"#fnr1-2902\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

Egoism hail from Sydney, Australia and stand firmly in a global line of brilliant dream pop. They just dropped the <em>On Our Minds</em> EP today, which they affectionately refer to as their shoegaze release. Most of the tracks have more of an indie pop sound, though, with subtle hints of gauzy textures. However, my favorite track, ‘Never Leave,’ has a little of Depreciation Guild in the last minute, sounding a bit like shoegaze flirting with chiptune. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>In the video for the first track off the EP, ‘Here’s The Thing,’ you get a good sense for the sound and aesthetic of Egoism.

I literally would have had no idea how to play this game (even with the little tutorial tips) without my 8-yr-old. He immediately picked up on the system and how to collect different elements and make things from them. He just started telling me how to play it, having never touched the game in his life. No doubt, playing games with similar mechanisms like Minecraft and Terraria prepared him, but it still amazed me. Within a short time of actually playing the game, he had an empire of monkeys doing his work for him as I tired myself hacking down trees with what looked like a piece of flint. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>I’ve had the game <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kingdom-new-lands/id1118513354\">Kingdom: New Lands</a> for some time but never really played it much. It’s got rabid fans, but every time I play it, I just ride back and forth through the 2D medieval landscape on my horse. I wasn’t getting much out of the horseback riding. My 8-yr-old started playing the game and then he said, “I’ve upgraded the economy.” I’m expecting him to tell me the GDP is booming, per capita income is through the roof and they have socialized medicine as I ride to the left of the hay bale then back the right again. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, I don’t really believe this is instinctual. The kid has stockpiled hours upon hours of playing games and watching various YouTube personalities play games in that little noggin of his. Many of today’s videogames have a fairly steep learning curve, though, and it’s impressive how quickly little minds can adapt to complex systems of play. </p>\n",

Mio has been posting artistic photos of albums for a few years, most recently focusing on body art to complement the album covers. Perusing through her astonishingly well executed posts could easily eat up a good chunk of your day. </p>\n\n<p>Her last post before the accident was this striking recreation of the artwork from Sufjan Stevens’ classic album <em>Come On Feel The Illinoise</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Although the brain injury she sustained effected her cognition and abilities, Mio is happy with what the experience has taught her. Chief among those lessons is the fact that we are not in control of our lives. The feeling of control is exposed as illusory in the face of disease, accidents, tragedies and other circumstances which we could neither predict nor prevent. In Mio’s case, the positive thing about her accident and subsequent recovery was her newfound ability to let go. </p>\n\n<p>I faced this loss of control most acutely in my freshman year of college. I was in my second semester when a blow to the chest from a mere paperback book caused the subsequent appearance of a tumor. Fast forward a few weeks and I was in the hospital being treated for lymphoma. When you are eighteen years old, you feel invincible, like nothing is going to dramatically alter your life trajectory. You never even consider things like cancer or another potentially terminal illness. The faith of my youth, which had been dormant in the last few years of high school,<sup><a href=\"#fn1-5203\" id=\"fnr1-5203\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> became reinvigorated when I realized that I was not in control of my life. I was blessed by, and at the mercy of, God’s providence. </p>\n\n<p>Though I was sick, I could still do things and appreciate what possibilities each day would bring. That summer with no hair, fighting cancer with drugs that would put me out for a whole day at a time, was one of the best I’ve had in my four and a half decades. Life was down to its very elements. Very few thoughts of the future detracted from my enjoyment of the present. I didn’t sweat the small stuff. From then on, one of my biggest challenges as the years passed by, would be to do what I could to hold on to that way of framing things. </p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-5203\">\n<p>That’s a story for another time. <a href=\"#fnr1-5203\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

Blogging is all about folks writing from their own point of view, drawing their lines in the sand around ideas, and working to be as honest as possible about how they show up and how they feel. I’ve had some incarnation of blogging since 1996 and I’m yearning to get back to it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This trend started a little while ago, but I still like the idea that people are coming to a simpler and more expressive form of blogging that developed in the earlier days of the internet. </p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2020/9f1c0a4844.jpg\" alt=\"Image via Rafaela Biazi at Unsplash\" />\n<figcaption>Image via Rafaela Biazi at <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/2N1lJCLrCj0\">Unsplash</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://austinkleon.com/2020/09/09/15-years-of-blogging-and-3-reasons-to-keep-going/\">Austin Kleon</a>, who is celebrating 15 years of blogging with enthusiasm and the desire to <em>keep going</em>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every time I start a new post, I never know for sure where it’s going to go. This is what writing and making art is all about: not having something to say, but finding out what you have to say. It’s thinking on the page or the screen or in whatever materials you manipulate. Blogging has taught me to embrace this kind of not-knowing in my other art and my writing. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I very much appreciate the idea of writing a blog post to work through your own thoughts. I recently did that in a post about <a href=\"https://frostedechoes.com/2020/09/05/it-doesnt-all.html\">straddling the political fence and staying out of the culture wars</a>, and it really helped me to clarify things that I had been thinking about for some time. </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Back in May, which now somehow seems like years ago, a bunch of folks with guns protesting COVID19-related restrictions paraded around the streets of neighboring downtown Raleigh, intimidating pedestrians and ordering submarine sandwiches. The ridiculousness of people with weapons such as inert rocket launchers ordering from the sandwich artists at a Subway franchise prompted the creation of many an internet meme. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n\n<p>It also helped to prompt a FBI investigation into those individuals who were involved. Now it appears that a couple of the members of the protest have been engaged in <a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article245518435.html\">trying to sell weapons parts to Hamas</a>. The two men, part of a group called the Boojahideen, have been plotting to commit terrorist acts against the US government. Apparently, they paired the rationale of domestic terrorism to that of international terrorism, which resulted in an opportunistic partnership with FBI agents posing as members of Hamas. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>They said they were willing to be mercenaries employed by Hamas and that they could make untraceable weapons, the news release stated. On July 30, they sold and negotiated a price for gun parts with a person they believed to be a senior member of Hamas — but who was actually an undercover FBI employee. Teeter and Solomon said they hoped the weapons would be used by Hamas to attack Israeli and U.S. soldiers, according to the news release. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This story underscores the danger we are in because of the current administration’s tendency to look the other way with regards to potential domestic terrorism. Actually, I say that with some degree of charity, as many will say that the current administration even encourages domestic terrorists. Here we see the reality that those who are planning attacks here and abroad can find idealogical and material common ground. </p>\n",

It was an interesting start to the weekend and I am thankful for the technical acumen of my coworkers (near and far) for helping us to get through the crisis. Afterward, it was slightly past my normal bedtime, but having been keyed up by the night’s events, I felt there were miles to go before sleep. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>As I sat in bed, my mind refusing to disengage from the day’s events, I knew I couldn’t just lie down and nod off. I broke my usual rule of not engaging in screen time at that late of an hour. I opened up my iPad to continue a blog post I had started about not being able to conform to today’s political packages. Unfortunately for my writing aspirations, my wife and youngest son were asleep, the little guy having indulged in his Friday ritual of spending the night in a sleeping bag on our bedroom floor. As I tried writing in the dark confines of the room, I found my typing failing me, whole thoughts being lost to the chaos of poking at random keys. Then I remembered, <a href=\"https://www.brydge.com/\">my new Brydge keyboard</a> has backlit keys. I couldn’t see which button was the right one to turn the feature on, so I fumbled through a number of them, at one point accidentally breaking the quiet of the night by turning on “Invincible Light” by TW Walsh, which elicited a groan from my dozing wife. After several misfires, I found the right button and turned the backlight on. It was perfect for the moment and got me writing again. </p>\n\n<p>My wife loves her iPad Brydge keyboard. After my iPad Smart Keyboard appeared to be not-so-smart after all and stopped working, I had to throw it away, and look for something new. My wife had been almost taunting me with the reliability of her keyboard and when I saw the older iPad Pro generation keyboards on sale at Brydge, I snapped the one for my model up at a cool one hundred bones. The keyboard has been a fantastic purchase and its build quality matches that of the Apple hardware. I use the word “hardware” very intentionally, as the floppy foldable keyboards from Apple, be they ever so “smart” or “magic” don’t seem to have that same level of quality. </p>\n\n<p>Here are some things that I can do now with my Brydge keyboard that I could not do with the Apple Smart Keyboard:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Sit in my bed or on my couch, without my lap desk and type out an email or blog post.</li>\n<li>As previously mentioned, type in a room with the lights out, when everyone else is sleeping.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I’m really happy with the Brydge keyboard and, in the lingua franca of marketing and net promoter scores, would highly recommend to a friend. </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>For a long time now, I’ve had a hard time fitting in politically. I’m adrift in the sea of American politics and even religion I know I’m not alone. I consider myself neither conservative nor progressive. When you study the Bible and Christianity, it’s hard to fit the beliefs you derive into the neat little packages that are offered by our political parties and cultural warriors. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2020/9535d6aa64.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>That doesn’t stop people from trying. It seems, most of the time, people bend their convictions to fit their political party. The tail wags the dog, these days. Fervor for political parties has increased seemingly proportionally as the influence of true religion has waned. In a piece for Christianity Today entitled <a href=\"https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2020/july/have-your-political-views-become-idol.html\">Have Your Political Views Become An Idol?</a>, Mary Lederleitner writes about political beliefs that have eclipsed spiritual beliefs. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jesus taught his followers that people would know we are Christians by our love (John 13:34-35), but political idolatry frequently holds opposing values. People begin thinking it is fine to hate, malign, publicly embarrass, ridicule and even bully those with different political views. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With such a strong tribal identity tied to politics, straddling the fence doesn’t win you any friends. Many people who are passionate about politics or religion either sit firmly on one side or the other. They either consider themselves progressive or conservative. </p>\n\n<p>In his book <em>Everything Belongs</em>, Richard Rohr examines the false exclusiveness of progressivism and conservatism from the words of Jesus. Jesus understood the importance of traditions and the need to welcome the wisdom of new understanding. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the thirteenth chapter of Matthew, he says, “This is what a scribe of the kingdom is like.” Scholars think he is describing himself. He continues, “He throws out the dragnet and pulls in things both old and new.” In other words, he preserves the best of what we call conservative and the best of what we call progressive. This is always a rare vocation, because it pleases hardly anybody, especially our own ego need to have the “whole truth.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Neither the progressive worldview or the conservative worldview can totally satisfy, though. If you want to have a consistent ethic of life, for example, you can’t stop at the borders between the red and blue. You can’t truly have care for others unless you try to help meet their needs and also ensure they are set upon the right path. The consummate progressive may emphasize the former but consider the latter too judgmental. The die hard conservative may eschew the former under the premise of personal responsibility but may even promote enforcement of the latter. The predetermined menus of values we are now offered obscure the rich buffet of the world of belief and disrupt consistent, end-to-end philosophies. </p>\n\n<p>It is unfortunate when someone believes they can take one aspect of your person and determine your positions on a wide variety of issues. We are multi-faceted, complex beings, with a range of biological determinants and life experiences. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do I contradict myself?<br/>\nVery well then I contradict myself,<br/>\n(I am large, I contain multitudes.)<br/>\n~ Walt Whitman, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/28117\">Leaves of Grass</a> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While Whitman muses on his contradictions, it’s important to note that many of the beliefs we are now told are contradictory are not necessarily so. Still, we contain multitudes. This seems to go unacknowledged in modern times. Increasingly we are looked at as narrow and thin or even one dimensional. As long as you can be folded in such a way as to fit into the right box, only then can you be understood. It is from these boxed packages of beliefs that the culture wars have been sustained. Kit Wilson writes for Arc Digital that we need more <a href=\"https://link.medium.com/WAksWJ1Uo9\">culture wars conscientious objectors</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But there is no rule woven into the universe that states that some specific opinion somebody holds must inevitably be linked with some other specific opinion, like atoms that are only configurable into a limited number of molecular combinations. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He goes on to lament the inclination for people to take one characteristic of a person and try to infer others from that single point. Our increasing reliance on inconsistent political frameworks to reduce the cognitive load of assessing people makes this more and more common. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We’re tired of being spoon-fed an ever-diminishing range of political views by even the most supposedly radical of artists. We’re tired of the assumption that your skin color or sexuality determines not only your politics, but your taste in music, literature and film, too. And we’re tired of the endless politicization of … everything. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We should reject the imposition of the particularly unique to the moment bundles of opinions. We can derive our own views and tastes. Let the Spirit, the wisdom contained in history and the insights still unfolding around us be our guide. In his book <em>A Diary of Private Prayer</em>, on the morning of the 14th day of the month, John Baillie prays:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Help me to make a stand today- ...<br/>\nfor the conservations of the rich traditions of the past;<br/>\nfor the recognition of new movements of your Spirit in the minds and lives of people today; </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I hope that we can consider these things when we are both forming our own systems of value and reflecting on the value systems of others.</p>\n",

That lasted a few months, and then I came across <a href=\"https://arcdigital.media/dave-filonis-the-clone-wars-unlocked-the-secret-to-star-wars-51c81ca588f4\">this post from Hannah Long</a> on Arc Digital. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<br>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://frostedechoes-test.micro.blog/uploads/2020/fb950be417.jpg\" alt=\"photo by Josh Howard on Unsplash\" />\n<figcaption>photo by Josh Howard on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/4CiyCjMxbZQ\">Unsplash</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>I love to see the variety of posts on Arc Digi, but this one reminds me of something that would have come from another of my favorite publications, <a href=\"https://christandpopculture.com/\">Christ and Pop Culture</a>. In it, Long examines the centrality of faith in the Star Wars universe and how, of all the new properties, <em>The Clone Wars</em> series handles that aspect best. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because here’s the thing people don’t get about Star Wars: it’s not about the space battles and laser swords. Nor is it about politics — in fact, the more political it is, the more boring it grows. Star Wars is about faith. (No wonder people get so mad about it online.) That explains the way we treat it and the way it’s written. It’s only by recognizing and embracing the religious nature of the story — and of its almost religious status in pop culture — that storytellers can capture the elusive “real” Star Wars.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have only seen parts of <em>The Clone Wars</em> series from George Lucas apprentice Dave Filoni.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-30861\" id=\"fnr1-30861\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> One day, my oldest son told us that the series started off a bit slow, but that it ended up being highly critically acclaimed. My youngest son took this to heart, and binged his way through the seven seasons of the show. This is how I became exposed and though indeed in the beginning it felt a bit formulaic and stilted, it gradually began to tell some fascinating stories. The <em>Siege of Mandalore</em> 4-episode arc is singled out in Long’s article for special praise.</p>\n\n<p>In the piece, Long writes about what sets the TV series apart from the recent Star Wars sequel movies. She looks at the difference in how the recent films have handled fidelity to the original stories. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The difference is in The Clone Wars’ religious philosophy. Unsurprisingly, Filoni approaches Star Wars with a religious sensibility similar to Lucas’s. Neither are worshipful and careful of the old canon like J. J. Abrams — both Lucas and Filoni take creative chances. But unlike Rian Johnson, neither are they instinctual iconoclasts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Long goes on to speculate about the religious beliefs that seem to drive Filoni’s stories.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Filoni draws inspiration from Tolkien’s books, which fueled his imagination as a kid. He’s compared Luke to Frodo and Ahsoka to Gandalf. He’s always posting Tolkien stuff. I don’t know anything about Filoni’s own religion, but I’m willing to bet his moral vision of the world is profoundly influenced by Tolkien’s, which was itself Catholic. Perhaps it’s a shaky connection to find, but those similarities lead me to predict that Filoni’s moral vision will prove more robust than that of competing stars in the Disney Star Wars constellation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Having not seen the entirety of <em>The Clone Wars</em>, and not having followed Dave Filoni closely, I can only comment so much on the conclusions that are drawn by Long in the piece. However, her analysis of the Star Wars movies I have seen is spot on, so I’m inclined to give her thoughts credibility. I will be watching for more Star Wars projects from Dave Filoni with great interest.<sup><a href=\"#fn2-30861\" id=\"fnr2-30861\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup></p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-30861\">\n<p>Dave Filoni also had a hand in the Mandalorian. <a href=\"#fnr1-30861\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-30861\">\n<p>That, of course, includes the second season of the Mandalorian. <a href=\"#fnr2-30861\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

The appeal of the record, with its tangibility, beauty and history, just keeps on growing.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not only have we been going through a pandemic, but manufacturing vinyl has become more difficult with the loss of several facilities that are critical parts of the supply chain.

Instead of seeing leadership from our government, asking Americans to make sacrifices to contain the virus, we witness inaction. It’s as if the image of Jimmy Carter in a cardigan asking for conservation of electricity has poisoned any political impulse to ask Americans to do something they may not want to do. If it were only reticence to ask for sacrifice that was holding us back, though, we might still be more successful at combating the disease.

From NPR: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/14/890628203/conspiracy-theories-aside-heres-what-contact-tracers-really-do\">Conspiracy Theories Aside, Here's What Contact Tracers Really Do</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Contact tracing is the public health practice of informing people when they've been exposed to a contagious disease. As it has become more widely employed across the U.S., it has also become mired in modern political polarization and conspiracy theories.</p>\n\n<p>Misinformation abounds, from tales that people who talk to contact tracers will be sent to nonexistent &quot;FEMA camps&quot; — a rumor so prevalent that health officials in Washington state had to put out a statement in May debunking it — to elaborate theories that the efforts are somehow part of a plot by global elites, such as the Clinton Foundation, Bill Gates or George Soros.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>​Our federal government winks and nods at the conspiracy theories that make unified efforts of disease control impossible. All that comes from our government serves to set people against each other. We will never have the unity required to fight a war until this changes.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>When Wilco’s incredibly critically acclaimed album <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em> came out, I remember reading a review of it on Amazon. To paraphrase the review, it said this is an amazing album, but you have to get it on compact disc. It assured the aspiring listener that on the CD, you could hear things that you wouldn’t hear on the MP3’s. Not long after that, I went to my friend’s record store, CD Alley, in Chapel Hill. “Your really have to get <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em> on vinyl,” he told me, “you can hear things on the record that you can’t hear on the CD.” I laughed, thinking about the online review.</p>\n\n<p>I guess that explains the hierarchy of sound quality (or at least, what many believe the sound quality hierarchy to be). MP3 < CD < Vinyl. </p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2020/ba4ac0ea72.jpg\" alt=\"Washed Out - Paracosm\" />\n<figcaption>Washed Out - Paracosm</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>I don’t consider myself a vinyl snob. I buy about half a dozen records a year from artists that I really like. Most of the time, I enjoy listening to music streaming from my iPhone to my Beats Pill or coming from my Amazon Echo as much as playing something on my trusty U-Turn turntable. Sometimes, though, you run across a record that actually does allow you to hear things you couldn’t on the digital version. One album, that has grown on me quite a bit over the years, Washed Out’s <em>Paracosm</em>, is such a record. For the recording, Ernest Green stepped outside his usual process and added a lot of live instruments and organic sounds. </p>\n\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18324-washed-out-paracosm/\">Pitchfork review</a> of the album:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Paracosm possesses more texture, which can be partially attributed to the presence of a live rhythm section. “Entrance” begins with chirping birds, and elsewhere there's snippets of laughter, harps, house parties, bongos, and slight swings of human imperfection in the rhythm section. “It All Feels Right” bumps with light reggae upticks before momentarily collapsing into a sunstroke, while “Great Escape” leans off the beat just enough to generate a little bit of Southern soul.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All of this really shines on the vinyl record. The aforementioned birds especially, in the beginning track, the appropriately titled “Entrance,” sound like they could be right outside your window. This is a warm weather record, and all the subtleties of summer embed themselves deeply in its grooves. Over top of that foundation, both the ebullience and contrasting mellow that together form the paradox of this time of year,<sup><a href=\"#fn1-28790\" id=\"fnr1-28790\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> establish themselves firmly in the sequencing of the tracks. Everything feels unhurried. Layers and textures envelop the listener in their sound. Even the flowers on the cover of the record are textured in a way that rewards the tactile. </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>I realize I’m writing about an old album from an artist that just released a new record. Honestly, though, I find reviews of classic record to sometimes be more helpful than reviews of albums that have just dropped. I want to know how the record holds up. What ages well and grows on you? What sounds dated as musical trends shift? How has the recording rewarded you over time?</em>\n<br>\n\n\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-28790\">\n<p>At least during a normal year, which 2020 is most certainly not. <a href=\"#fnr1-28790\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>The days are piling up on one another. Their beginning, middle and end feel strikingly familiar. One bleeds into the next. I’ve heard others describe it as <em>Groundhog Day</em>. At some point during this endless string of days, it became clear to me that I had to do something to get my boys out of the house. We limit even their ability to go with us to stores to reduce their risk of exposure to COVID. As a consequence, they spent the greater portion of their days either playing video games or watching YouTube videos of people playing video games. </p>\n\n<p>One problem with any kind of outdoor activity at this time of year, going to the neighborhood pool in carefully planned trips booked in advance excepted, is the heat. My sons seem especially ill-adapted to the hot North Carolina summers and days of isolation in a climate controlled house probably aren’t helping any. Getting them to partake of exercise is a challenge. My youngest kind of runs back and forth, as some YouTuber excitedly narrates their Minecraft run in the background, but my oldest has perfected the teenage sedentary life. He slouches at his desk, playing games or chatting with his friends via an iMac that I vowed would never end up in his room until the need to work from home forced me to remove it from my office. </p>\n\n<p>An idea finally came to me that I could take the boys to play disc golf. My older one was excited, but it was a bit harder to stoke the enthusiasm of the younger one. He had never played before and had no conception of what the activity consisted of but understood that it would be out in the elements and wouldn’t involved pushing pixelated characters around a screen. </p>\n\n<p>We could have gone to a local course, but I insisted on driving an extra 15 minutes to the course in the capital city that I used to play every night, in the summer, the year I went through chemo. I have an emotional connection to the <a href=\"https://raleighnc.gov/places/kentwood-park\">Kentwood Park</a> course, and I don’t think any others will ever replace it as my default, no matter how many spring up closer to my house. My decision to make the drive was a good one, as my oldest was happy to be in the car, going somewhere, and the drive seemed to elevate his mood. </p>\n\n<p>Despite the already high temperature in the later morning, the course was packed. We practiced putting while waiting patiently to line up on the first tee box. My youngest seemed to think he would either be an ace the first few times he threw the disc, or that he wasn’t meant to play at all. You can guess which way that turned out. Though he gamely trudged along, playing from where the disc landed, no matter how close to his original position, he missed few opportunities to complain. His throws didn’t always go where he wanted them to, the basket was too far away, the heat was unbearable. We ended after nine holes. </p>\n\n<p>After all the complaints,<sup><a href=\"#fn1-25854\" id=\"fnr1-25854\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> as we drove home my oldest talked about how fun it was. The youngest had to grudgingly agree that it was kind of enjoyable. A disc is no substitute for a gaming controller, but kids need the outdoors, and I plan to make this more of a regular thing to keep them active.<sup><a href=\"#fn2-25854\" id=\"fnr2-25854\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> </p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-25854\">\n<p>My wife warned me about this, so it’s fair to say I knew what I was getting into. <a href=\"#fnr1-25854\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-25854\">\n<p>Planned activity is important as school is now going to be entirely remote this year. <a href=\"#fnr2-25854\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Filmed in Osaka and Kyoto, this short film by Brett Novak follows Japanese skateboarder Isamu Yamamoto as he freestyles his way around ancient structures. Isamu is obviously deeply influenced by Rodney Mullen, and brings back a style of skateboarding that hasn't been seen much since Mullen and Per Welinder ruled the streets in the 80's. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>{{< youtube MmJ2w7tXRGc >}}</p>\n\n<p>Mullen was a spectator, when, at the age of 14, Yamamoto took first place at the World Freestyle Round-Up Skateboarding Championships in BC, Canada. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you see street skaters, they will map together a line where there is continuity of movement—a switch backside 180 flip combined with a frontside flip, for example. You see symmetry and consistency. Tricks move with a certain grain – to a musician, it would be something like a tonal chord. Isamu has continuity, tempo and acuity that most others do not. He strings things together with competence, flow and unparalleled timing. That was something that no one held a candle to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although Mullen focuses on the elements of street skating that were influenced by freestyle, freestyle itself has different characteristics than modern street skating. Street skateboarders don’t tend to stay in one spot, whereas freestylers sometimes plant themselves like a fixed point on a map, rotating and bouncing in place. The flow and energy feels less longitudinal and almost more contemplative. Although moving from once obstacle to the next is part of the charm and challenge of street skating, it’s enjoyable to watch a different form manifest itself from a prodigy like Isamu Yamamoto. </p>\n\n<p>Via <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-sports/watch-14-year-old-japanese-skateboarding-prodigys-breathtaking-film-111319/\">Rolling Stone</a></p>\n",

Barr believes that major tech companies are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-barr-idUSKCN24H2JT\">making serious compromises</a> in order to get access to the Chinese labor and consumer market. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report,” Barr said. “America’s big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the article, one of the tech companies named, Apple, declined to comment. How could they offer any explanation? They are at the mercy of China for the products that are made almost entirely in that country. </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>With human rights abuses becoming more and more apparent and egregious in China, how long can US companies continue to pretend not to notice? It’s difficult to ignore <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/chinese-ambassador-xinjiang-blindfolded-prisoners-27403813-0677-4abd-bfe6-f61516f13fbc.html\">trains full of blindfolded, shaved prisoners</a>.

Plugins feel like a big step in the maturity of the platform and allow those with the technical savvy to extend the features of the service. </p>\n\n<p>The official photo app for Micro.blog, Sunlit, is due to get an update soon.

One of the most promising apps is a mobile, cross platform client called Gluon. While Gluon is not new, it is being rewritten from the ground up. Gluon is made by M.b. user <a href=\"https://micro.blog/vincent\">@vincent</a>, who spends his time on development of this app because <a href=\"https://vincentritter.com/2020/07/13/taking-feature-requests-for-the-next-version-of-gluon-on-the-apple-platforms\">he cares about the longevity and experience of the service</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I love the Micro.blog community greatly.

Manton has done such an amazing job with it and it really seems to attract the last \"good\" people on this planet. There are times I really think the world has gone down the drain, but then I open my feed and see lots of wonderful posts from so many people. Not to mention the utmost support from people when you're down. Here to pick you up!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Gluon is Vincent’s way of giving back to the community he loves. The client is elegant and refined. While the official Micro.blog client does what it says on the tin, Gluon offers an experience that feels more premium, similar to app from the likes of the Iconfactory. </p>\n<br>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2020/7833744496.png\" alt=\"Profile page from Gluon for Micro.blog\" />\n<figcaption>Profile page from <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gluon-for-micro-blog/id1437753701\">Gluon for Micro.blog</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>It’s great to see the user community giving back to the Micro.blog ecosystem because they enjoy being a part of it and want to do something to benefit their fellow users. </p>\n",

In the piece, he describes how a group called ReopenNC recently organized a protest against current restrictions put in place by the governor. When a reporter asked a man at the protest to discuss his thoughts on wearing face coverings, he responded with a sarcastic dismissal. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I can’t hear you,” said the man, who declined to give his name. “You’ll have to take off your mask.” When the question became louder, the man said: “It’s about freedom. Masks are about fear. That’s all you need to know.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://biologos.org/articles/walking-by-faith-and-wearing-a-mask/\">Walking by Faith and Wearing a Mask</a>, biophysicist Matthew Pevarnik explains why wearing a face mask now can be an act of Christian faith and has nothing to do with fear. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>While I am not personally in an at-risk category, I don’t wear the face mask for me. I wear it for the 13 million Americans over 65 that live in multigenerational households who can’t just “cocoon away” while the rest of the population gets herd immunity, or for those that have or live with those asthma, chronic heart disease, diabetes, cancer diagnosed in the last year, hematological malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma, or had an organ transplant and more. What if my wearing a mask could have saved the life of a single mother of six who beat breast cancer? Scripture testifies to God’s special compassion for those that are the most vulnerable, for the poor or widows, or the foreigner in the land, and this is a small way that we look out for them, or metaphorically “leave our grain for the fatherless, the widow and the foreigner” <em>(Deuteronomy 24:19)</em>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have to admit, despite knowing that masks are more effective when worn by those who are infected to keep them from passing the infection to others, I often feel like I’m protecting myself when I wear mine. I’ll be wearing my mask anyway<sup><a href=\"#fn1-30742\" id=\"fnr1-30742\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>, but it’s time for my thinking to shift to a mindset of protecting others. </p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-30742\">\n<p>Which is now a mandate in N.C., thank goodness. <a href=\"#fnr1-30742\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

He makes some good points, although some of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RottenInDenmark/status/1271197002353610752?s=20\">his examples</a> of cancel culture might not be entirely accurate. </p>\n\n<p>What struck me, though, was a particular paragraph listing situations where people were trying hard to show their respect for the African American community. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each passing day sees more scenes that recall something closer to cult religion than politics. White protesters in Floyd’s Houston hometown kneeling and praying to black residents for “forgiveness… for years and years of racism” are one thing, but what are we to make of white police in Cary, North Carolina, kneeling and washing the feet of Black pastors? What about Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer kneeling while dressed in “African kente cloth scarves”?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Each year, during the worship service that starts the season of Lent, Forgiveness Sunday, Orthodox Christians go one by one requesting forgiveness of one another, usually hugging as they do so. This doesn’t sound a whole lot different that the situation Taibbi describes in Houston. I live 5 minutes from Cary, NC, and I didn’t hear about the officers washing the feet of pastors. However, I met some of those officers when they did a session on race relations a couple of years ago at the Cary church I attend. They were <a href=\"https://www.wunc.org/post/how-barbershop-brought-cary-community-closer\">serious about improving race relations</a>, before the death of George Floyd, working with the community they serve to make sure that was a priority. One might say it is a particular mission of the Cary PD. In this instance, though, the report of the officers washing the feet of the pastors was <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2020/06/14/no-police-officers-didnt-wash-protesters-feet-in-north-carolina/\">not even true</a>. The officers were there to support white pastors washing the feet of black pastors in a show of solidarity and request for forgiveness. </p>\n\n<p>I’m not sure if Taibbi is aware, but feet washing has been a part of Christian practice, since Christ did it for his disciples (<em>John 13:1-17</em>), before what is commonly known as The Last Supper. It is emblematic of the faith of one who came, not to be served, but to serve (<em>Matthew 20:28</em>). No less than the king of France (in the age where kings held absolute power), Louis IX, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_IX_of_France\">used to wash the feet of his subjects</a>, so zealous was he to show his Christian faith. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Louis was renowned for his charity. Beggars were fed from his table, he ate their leavings, washed their feet, ministered to the wants of the lepers, and daily fed over one hundred poor. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Pope washes the feet of prisoners and refugees. When he does so, he is just contributing to a long Christian/Catholic tradition of humility and service. </p>\n\n<p>Fred Rogers <a href=\"https://christandpopculture.com/wont-you-be-my-neighbor-mister-rogers/\">made a similar gesture with Francois Clemmons</a>, playing the role of an African American police officer, as they placed both of their feet in a small pool to make a point in a time when many swimming pools were not integrated. His point in doing so was to focus on racial reconciliation, much in the same way the Cary police officers have done for the last few years. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But here in Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, only five years later, a quiet Presbyterian minister and an African-American police officer show the world how to integrate swimming pools. Rogers invites; Clemmons accepts. As Clemmons slips his feet into the pool, the camera holds the shot for several seconds, as if to make the point clear: a pair of brown feet and a pair of white feet can share a swimming pool.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In referring to Christian practices as cultish, Taibbi comes off as sounding a bit like one of the ancient Romans, many of whom didn’t understand the religion. I expect we will see more of this type of thing as we move into a post-Christian period. Foot washing has been practiced in many different contexts, to show love and service for one another in the manner of Christ. While some of Taibbi’s points land with chilling implications, his ignorance about certain traditions and his readiness to jump on unsubstantiated Twitter rumors somewhat damage the credibility of his claims. </p>\n",

Very few of my most treasured albums were recorded in a live context. The majority of the time, I find live recordings to be inferior versions of their studio-recorded counterparts. Right now, though, I’m mostly home bound, unable to attend gatherings where music would be played. I had tickets to see Tennis perform in May, but that was postponed indefinitely. I don't foresee that show, or any others, returning in the next few months. </p>\n\n<p>Living through this, live recordings can slake a sort of thirst that isn’t getting quenched any other means. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2020/05/29/864470936/stream-over-100-shows-from-the-9-30-club\">NPR has unlocked over 100 performances</a> from the legendary 9:30 Club in Washington DC to fill in the gap. I'm creating a habit of listening through a live performance on weeknights. I started with <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2007/10/20/15298176/stars-new-buffalo-in-concert\">this Stars show</a> from 2007. As expected, the songs don’t sound as good as they do on the records, but there’s a certain energy and spontaneity to them. There is also a sense of nostalgia that is invoked by these little time capsules. They take you back to an earlier time in an artist’s career as well as a different part of your life. </p>\n\n<p>The downside to these live performances has to do with some of the technology involved. The sets are each presented as one monolithic piece. Those who are used to track divisions and song identification from live albums may be put off by the lack of those things in the simplistic player that NPR offers. </p>\n\n<p>NPR also has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2020/05/29/863722379/the-9-30-club-is-40-years-old-its-closed-it-matters-more-than-ever\">an accompanying piece about the 9:30 Club</a> by <em>All Songs Considered</em> host, Bob Boilen. The club is 40 years old, though it remains closed, which makes it harder to celebrate its legacy. When it opened, according to its own typewritten promotional material, it was “the first non-disco niteclub to open in downtown D.C. in thirteen years.” I’ve never actually been to the club, as my dad saw to it that I couldn’t go as a teen living in Northern Virginia. My cousin worked there for much of his adult life, though. </p>\n\n<p>Boilen clearly loves the venue and the rich experiences that it provided for him. He ends the piece by advising us to have the same affection and dedication to the clubs wherever we may live. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So in that spirit, celebrate the clubs in your town. There are many more venues in D.C. now than there were in 1980, but not all of them are likely to survive this pandemic. There's a newly formed organization called NIVA is taking action to help support venues. If there's a club you love, new or old, remember that they are part of the fabric of your community. These places that have given so much to us and, in turn, to the artists who have energized, galvanized and changed many of our lives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

I mean the protests that catch people’s attention and make them take a pause and start thinking about what right looks like and how we get there. I mean <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/sports/football/trump-anthem-kneeling-kaepernick.html\">the apology from NFL commissioner Roger Goodell</a>, who should have been for peaceful protest the entire time, instead of following the president’s calls to divide and label people enemies. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Soon after, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1269034074552721408\">Goodell responded with his own video</a> in which he made his strongest and most specific support of the demands and goals of African-American players.

I mean continued awareness and progress. </p>\n\n<p>That all being said, I also want people to keep going about kingdom work in all sorts of ways. Not everyone has to be a slacktivist on social media for the cause that captures the spotlight for the moment. Alan Jacobs <a href=\"https://blog.ayjay.org/not-so-much/\">writes about this aspect</a> of our collective focus.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If three months ago you were primarily focused on addressing sexism in the workplace, it seems to me that you ought to be allowed, indeed encouraged, to keep thinking about and working on that now, when everyone else is talking about police brutality. If your passionate concern is the lack of health care in poor communities, here or abroad, I think you should stick with that, even if it means not joining in protests against police racism. If you’ve turned your farm into a shelter for abused or neglected animals, and caring for them doesn’t leave you time to get on social media with today’s approved hashtags, bless you. You’re doing the Lord’s work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Keep trying to bring about change for the better where you can and where you are led.</p>\n",

For using the words of other racist leaders of the past, to call for potentially lethal violence upon US citizens, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/twittercomms/status/1266267447838949378?s=21\">he has been censured by Twitter</a>. Many of us were skeptical that the day would ever come that Twitter would enforce their own terms of service. While praise for Twitter always comes to me with reluctance, given their past negligence, they have done <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-silent-trump-shooting-post-203353502.html\">what Facebook will not</a>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If Twitter’s decision to hide Donald Trump’s tweet has amped up the pressure on Facebook to do the same, it hasn’t resulted in any noticeable action from the social network. </p>\n\n<p>Twitter said in a statement Trump’s words received the label “in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts.” The same tweet was again labeled when it was subsequently posted by the official White House Twitter account. </p>\n\n<p>But the words didn’t just appear on Twitter. As with other Trump tweets, it was also cross-posted to Trump’s Facebook and Instagram account. Facebook, though, has not taken any action on the posts, despite also having rules against glorifying violence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This comes as no surprise, after Facebook <a href=\"https://frostedechoes.com/2019/10/19/chipping-away-at.html\">openly implemented a policy of allowing political ads that were provably false</a> to maintain an important source of their revenue and deceptively project a veneer of neutrality. It doesn’t take much analysis to realize that any policy that benefits only the dishonest, is not neutral, but is in fact taking the side the deceivers. </p>\n\n<p>The assymetrical violence of calling for the killing of looters is terrifying. It also fits within the broader narrative that has forced this chain of events upon us. White collar actors who <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/greed-and-debt-the-true-story-of-mitt-romney-and-bain-capital-183291/\">benefit from systematically dismantling companies</a> to loot them in a way that is recognized as legal are rewarded monetarily for their actions. Those of us who grew up on KB Toys and Toys R’ Us <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/toys-r-us-bankruptcy-private-equity/561758/\">saw them get looted by private equity firms</a> and individuals that are still highly esteemed and respected. </p>\n\n<p>The Onion <a href=\"https://www.theonion.com/protestors-criticized-for-looting-businesses-without-fo-1843735351\">has a piece</a> that points out this hypocrisy with scathingly dark humor. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Look, we all have the right to protest, but that doesn’t mean you can just rush in and destroy any business without gathering a group of clandestine investors to purchase it at a severely reduced price and slowly bleed it to death,” said Facebook commenter Amy Mulrain, echoing the sentiments of detractors nationwide who blasted the demonstrators for not hiring a consultant group to take stock of a struggling company’s assets before plundering. “I understand that people are angry, but they shouldn’t just endanger businesses without even a thought to enriching themselves through leveraged buyouts and across-the-board terminations. It’s disgusting to put workers at risk by looting. You do it by chipping away at their health benefits and eventually laying them off. There’s a right way and wrong way to do this.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s difficult to acquiesce to destruction of property. It appears that, in the case of Minneapolis, at least some of the destruction has come from <a href=\"https://www.patrickrhone.net/we-know/\">agitators outside of the community</a>. However, when a pot boils over isn’t the one to blame the person who saw it bubbling and didn’t turn down the heat? When a positive community influencer and <a href=\"https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2020/may/george-floyd-ministry-houston-third-ward-church.html\">messenger of the gospel</a> is brazenly killed with impunity by the state, what are the people to do?</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>In this week’s <em>Moore To The Point</em> newsletter, Russell Moore dives into conspiracy theories, with an emphasis on their context in Christian circles. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The reason that crazy conspiracy theories get a hearing in Christian circles is not because most Christians believe them. In talking with a pastor with flat-earth, moon-landing denialists in his church, I asked, “How many of your people are convinced by that stuff?” He said, “No one but the one family, but the people who think the earth is not flat don’t wake up in the morning caring about that; these people do.” So what happens is that the pastor, just out of exhaustion, censors himself from saying things like “Let’s pray for our missionaries around the globe” because he doesn’t want the emails the next day accusing him of being a secret liberal. And the 99.5 percent of the people in his church just think, “Bless their hearts” but don’t say anything—out of kindness, I suppose. There’s a noble impulse there. We all are called to bear each other’s craziness, to some degree. But there’s a point at which it’s not just quirkiness but destructive and predatory (1 Tim. 6:4; 2 Tim. 2:23-24; Titus 2:9-10). And the church, in witness and in joy, suffers for it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>​He’s right that churches suffer for the falsehoods conceived of, or spread by, their members. It damages the credibility of their witness for Christ. If they can believe things which are so obviously false, one wonders, what about the rest of their beliefs? </p>\n\n<p>Wrong beliefs can also be sources of conflict, even as in the illustration of the church member above and their correspondence with the pastor. This is where the passage from Timothy that Moore cites comes into play. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That person is conceited. They don’t understand anything but have a sick obsession with debates and arguments. This creates jealousy, conflict, verbal abuse, and evil suspicions. <em>(1 Timothy 6:4, CEB)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It may be simplistic to say, not having ever pastored a flock of believers, but I don’t think I could bring myself to change my message to suite the misguided obsessions of a single family of members. Let’s still pray for our missionaries around the globe, whether someone believes in a globe or not. </p>\n",

It was both a reward to myself and a tool for taking notes on the exam topics. I have been using it heavily ever since. When the COVID crisis forced many of us knowledge workers home, I had to rework my home office configuration. That meant that my primary computer, my iMac, had to live someplace else. Reluctantly, I moved that to a desk in my boys’ room. I had always said they would never have a TV or computer in their room, but desperate times call for desperate measures. </p>\n\n<p>When I lost my primary computer to my children, my iPad became my main personal computer. It’s a bit more limited than my iMac but I have long been adjusting to use it to get things done. It has helped a lot that Apple introduced trackpad support around the same time that I had to go all iPad. At first, I considered buying a more recent refurbished iPad Pro in order to get an upgrade and buy either a Brydge Pro keyboard with trackpad or one of the new Magic Keyboards with the trackpad. Andy Nicolaides from <a href=\"https://thedent.net\">TheDent.net</a> warned me away from the Brydge keyboard, as the trackpad from that <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/04/review-brydge-pro-ipad-keyboard-with-trackpad/\">seems made for the older trackpad support</a> and is glitchy with the most recent changes. </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, I decided against even the newer iPad Pro with the magic keyboard. I just couldn’t justify spending the money on that at this time and fully recognized that all I really needed was a new trackpad. My old Magic Trackpad from Apple will work with the iPad, but won’t scroll, making it essentially useless. I bought one of the sleek Magic Trackpad 2’s and am very happy with my setup. While the cursor isn’t perfected yet on iPadOS (sometimes you have to double-click a link or button, sometimes single click is sufficient), the cursor technology seems in some ways so much more advanced than what has been the standard for the last 40 years. I can do almost everything that I need to on this machine. There are still some things I can’t do, like download songs from Bandcamp and add them to my Music Library. For those few things, I have to borrow some time from my kids. For most things, though, I’ve adapted. </p>\n\n<p>I’m not regretting that I didn’t upgrade. For one reason, I wouldn’t want to have to deal with <a href=\"https://thedent.net/grimegate/\">grimegate</a>. If I spent that much on a machine + keyboard and then it looked worn after a week, I would be seriously frustrated. I’m happy with what Patrick Rhone refers to as “good enough tech.” Sometimes I do think about the fact that the much cheaper iPad my wife got for Christmas is essentially the same as my iPad Pro from a couple of years ago, but I’m okay with that. His and hers iPads suite us. </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Marius Masalar has some thoughts about blogging and <a href=\"https://mariusmasalar.me/link-posts\">link posts</a>. Masalar sees a lot of value in them and the role they play in the makeup of the IndieWeb. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>At their best, link posts are a way for independent bloggers to engage with and continue a conversation started by one of their fellows.</p>\n\n<p>We use them to boost each other up, offer constructive criticism, point out other views, or amplify a message we believe in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He makes a point, though, that link posts should contain something of value from the curator. What does the person linking to the content think about it? It’s best practice to try and explain why someone should make the jump. There are a billion things on the internet and all sorts of entertainment offline, as well. It’s up to the blogger who is linking to something to at least briefly explain why it is worth the reader’s time. It shows respect and a genuine desire to point followers to things that they might find compelling. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There’s no right or wrong way to do this, and I’m not suggesting that people who share links without commentary are committing some sort of crime against the indie web. However, if you’re going to share new ideas and experiences with someone, it seems courteous to do so with the same care and attention you’d grant them if you were making the recommendation in person.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course, there’s nothing intrinsically wrong with sharing nothing but a link, but the effort to put your own take on things ultimately rewards your readers.</p>\n\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://pjrvs.com/blogger\">view related to this</a> is from Paul Jarvis, who laments the decline of small b blogging. Small b blogging being that art of writing for those who share interests, without thought to growth or gaming the system for metrics. In that model, presenting your own take on things found around the interwebs is integral to the implied contract with those who follow your blog. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Content is rewarded now through the act of getting someone to a website. Who cares if they read something, who cares if something was written well, who cares if there’s even content. Content now needs likes, shares, outrage, promotion, and to rank high in Google. Content online has gone from acting like an e-zine to being what it started out counter to, and that’s mass, mainstream media.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Small b blogging follows that e-zine model and differentiates itself by being honest about its intentions. Part of that is the explanation and the personal reasons for why you are linking to something you found and want to share. </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I’ve been trying Wordpress out for a long time. I’d be embarrassed to tell you how many innocent AWS EC2 instances died horrible deaths so I could experiment with self-hosted Wordpress installations. It’s almost sadistic. Yet I keep checking out the platform, hoping to find that perfect theme, and that ideal blogging workflow that allows me to write in a good text editor, post through a robust API and like the way it comes out when a reader sees it. </p>\n\n<p>Until recently, I was still searching. When I found this year’s flagship Wordpress theme, “Twenty Twenty,” I thought I had my match. None of the Wordpress.com themes offer extensive customizations, but this one more than most. It was also a whole lot easier than hosting your own Wordpress installation, making a child theme and going through all of the work of customizing settings like fonts. Sure, you have to upgrade to a business plan that most bloggers don’t need to make any of your own CSS edits, but who needs that if the theme has enough options? </p>\n\n<p>Early on, though, I ran in to a big bug (no pun intended). The theme’s “normal” size font is big. It looks great on mobile, but not so much anywhere else. The problem is, when you change the font from “normal” to “small” it actually gets bigger. I was completely dumbfounded by that bit of font maleficia. </p>\n\n<p>After some time of living with the bug, but not really liking how my posts looked on a desktop machine, I decided to email Wordpress support. They were aware of the bug, they told me, and the theme developers were looking into it, but they had no estimate of when the bug would be fixed. I was surprised that they wouldn’t fix a font size bug on their flagship theme in relatively short order, and told them as much. Their next email assured me the bug was in testing but they still had no date on a release. </p>\n\n<p>I waited a month, sometimes trying the font size option out, to see if things would get fixed. With no movement, I emailed them again. They responded that they still had no time frame, although they did send me a <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/themes/issues/1817#issuecomment-610227812\">link to the bug on Github</a>. Unfortunately, the bug in Github doesn’t seem to indicate that a fix is in testing. In fact, it indicates no one has even been assigned to look at the issue. </p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2020/bc434f9cbd.jpg\" alt=\"Wordpress font bug\" />\n<figcaption>Wordpress font bug</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>In parallel to this nonsense with the Wordpress issue, something I didn’t expect happened. <a href=\"https://ia.net/writer\">IA Writer</a>, a longtime favorite text editor of mine, and one which I used to post to Wordpress and Ghost blogging platforms, added support for Micropub. This means you can now post to your self-hosted Micropub blog or to the excellent <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a> platform. I have been a long-time user of Micro.blog, but the only way I could post longer blog posts on it with images was using the Drafts app. Draft’s Swiss-Army-Knife capabilities are great, but it doesn’t really excel at facilitating longer blog posts and its design is something that is best overlooked. So I eventually joined the herd and moved from M.b. to Wordpress. Now, with IA Writer supporting it, I’m back to M.b.</p>\n\n<p>Micro.blog uses the Hugo static blogging engine and is extremely customizable, no additional plan other than basic hosting needed. It’s also based around markdown, which has long been my preferred method of writing for the web. It doesn’t have the same plethora of WYSIWYG options as the Wordpress Gutenberg editor, but it has what a humble blogger like myself needs. In addition, it is getting better all of the time. I’m happy to support a strong IndieWeb alternative to the great behemoth that is Wordpress. </p>\n",

The movie debuted to mixed reactions from fans and critics. There were plenty of think pieces arguing over the faults in the narrative and the ending of the iconic series, and one would expect no less for something that has become as polarizing as the Star Wars series. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jason Morehead <a href=\"https://opuszine.us/posts/drew-mcweeny-fan-expectations-prognostications\">wrote about this phenomenon</a> a few months ago.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I was recently discussing <em>Star Wars</em> with some friends, and one of them remarked that nobody hates <em>Star Wars</em> as much as <em>Star Wars</em> fans. We had a good laugh at that, but he was right — and it’s not only true for <em>Star Wars</em>, but also for any nerdy pop culture property with a decent following. We love to tear down the things we love because they don’t live up to our (unrealistic) expectations, or betray a nostalgia-influenced sense of how it “should” be, or introduce elements we could do without — and on the reasons go.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the most common criticisms of the final installment in the series that resonated particularly with me was constraining those with force-sensitivity to the members of a couple of dynasties. If Rian Johnson did anything right with the previous movie, it was setup an ending that teased the imagination with the possibilities of new characters becoming in tune with the force. New heroes potentially emerging that didn’t have to come from any particular lineage. The democratization of the force was a welcome addition as the series began to draw to a close. Unfortunately, in the last movie, JJ Abrams decided to jettison those notions in favor what had worked for the series all along for most of its history. As ridiculous as it sounds, only a few chosen people could access the cosmic force that tied all life together. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:pullquote {\"textColor\":\"secondary\",\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote is-style-default\"><blockquote class=\"has-text-color has-secondary-color\"><p>So, while movie criticism is a wonderful way of deconstructing the stories we observe on our screens, sometimes it’s okay to just enjoy an adventure with characters we can admire and villains we can root against.</p></blockquote></figure>\n<!-- /wp:pullquote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What you won’t find in JJ Abrams vision, though, is a need to bend a story cobbled together from ancient narratives to the spirit of the age. You won’t find a galaxy populated by deeply flawed men who need to be saved by women who share, quite literally, not a flaw amongst them. There are no long and laborious sidebars admonishing the viewer that wealth is a gateway drug to wanton hedonism. The attempts to pander to modern sensibilities in Johnson’s <em>The Last Jedi</em> are so obvious to the naked eye that they barely merit any scrutiny. Not so with Abram’s apparent intention to continue a series that spoke first and foremost to its fans. The only pandering you will find in the final movie is to those who have been adherents of the series’ mythology.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, while movie criticism is a wonderful way of deconstructing the stories we observe on our screens, sometimes it’s okay to just enjoy an adventure with characters we can admire and villains we can root against.

				"content_text": "<p>Jeremy D. Larsen, <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/article/listen-to-music/\">writing for Pitchfork</a>, uses the riotous 1913 Paris debut performance of Stravinsky’s <em>The Rite of Spring</em> to illustrate the difficulty our brains have in enjoying new music. The performance, to perhaps understate the effect, took its audience outside of their sonic comfort zones. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many members of the audience could not fathom this new music; their brains—figuratively, but to a certain extent, literally—broke. A brawl ensued, vegetables were thrown, and 40 people were ejected from the theater. It was a fiasco consonant with Stravinsky’s full-bore attack on the received history of classical music, and thus, every delicate sense in the room. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He goes on to explain why new music, truly different music, is so hard for us to enjoy. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>People love the stuff they already know. It’s a dictum too obvious to dissect, a positive-feedback loop as stale as the air in our self-isolation chambers: We love the things we know because we know them and therefore we love them. But there is a physiological explanation for our nostalgia and our desire to seek comfort in the familiar. It can help us understand why listening to new music is so hard, and why it can make us feel uneasy, angry, or even riotous. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>​I’ve often read that our musical tastes solidify somewhere in the late high school/college years. I like to think I’m an exception to that, because I still spend a fair amount of time seeking out new music. I read music blogs and diligently check out their recommendations. I listen to the Apple New Music playlist that is algorithmically curated for me every Friday, comparing my list with my wife’s. I make a new playlist every month, comprised of mostly fresh tracks (with some evergreens thrown in for good measure).</p>\n\n<p>How exceptional am I really, though? Is the new music I like that much different than what I would have liked in the past? Is it really challenging me?</p>\n\n<p>For example, one of my new favorite songs is “I Feel Alive” by the band TOPS. The band describes itself as “a raw punk take on AM studio pop,” though it feels like more of the latter. So of course I like it! The band itself is fairly new, but I got introduced to music by AM studio pop in the seventies and I spent my high school years listening to punk. </p>\n<br>\n<p>{{< youtube gG79QGmKt7U >}}</p>\n\n<p>It is true that I do listen to things that I wouldn’t have in high school. Don’t tell anyone, but I didn’t really like My Bloody Valentine’s <em>Loveless</em> when it came out. I can’t imagine having enjoyed the Velvet Underground at the same time I was exploring industrial bands. However, the noisy rock and quiet modes of the VU did influence a lot of the bands I listened to in high school and college, so again, eventually liking them is hardly a stretch. I never would have been into sophistipop in the nineties, but having grown up in the eighties, I was able to appreciate it more when teenage angst died down. </p>\n\n<p>I plan to keep exploring new music, but I don’t expect my tastes to change in a revolutionary way. Whenever I so much as look at the band/artist names that are trending on Apple Music, I’m just not sure what to make of them. </p>\n\n<p>I’m happy that my tastes didn’t get stuck in a lock groove in 1994, but I’m also cognizant that there is a familiarity and sometimes nostalgia with even the new music that I appreciate. </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>It’s worth noting that I also don’t like a lot of the stuff I did in my teens. Those industrial bands didn’t stick with me, and neither did hip hop or ska or half a dozen other genres I threw myself into for a while.</em> </p>\n",

His reference for Roam was <a href=\"https://drewcoffman.com/\">Drew Coffman</a>. I love Drew, and he attaches to new ideas with the zeal of an ancient Athenian. <a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\">Roam</a> bares more resemblance to a wiki than anything else, but its proponents insist it’s a completely new way of <em>thinking</em> about note taking. The service is thick with enthusiastic documentation on how to use it for different purposes, adapting it to GTD, increasing your speed and productivity with a plethora of keyboard shortcuts, etc. </p>\n\n<p>There’s even an <a href=\"https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam\">org-roam</a> for Emacs. Which you may need, <a href=\"https://www.copingmechanism.com/2020/ill-be-using-org-roam-for-the-time-being\">if you can’t access the cloud database</a> of your notes. </p>\n<br>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2020/b1008832fb.jpg\" alt=\"Roam Reference interface\" />\n<figcaption>Roam Reference interface</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br>\n\n<p>Roam only has a web app, and it’s not a particularly attractive one, at that. The site for the service partially obscures this by resizing browser windows in screenshots to make things seem a bit more native. The app just looks clunky, though. There are more bullets than a early-20th-century Chicago gangland murder scene. Perhaps a bit unintuitively, you can turn most of the bullets off by right-clicking on the title of the page. Otherwise, you end up looking like a PowerPoint junkie in desperate need of a fix. </p>\n\n<p>The big draw with Roam seems to be the ability to create linked notes on the fly, by typing the name of a new note in double brackets. It is a cool idea, although I could also see it creating a fairly unwieldy database or a bunch of empty pages waiting for content that never comes. I’d like to see apps like <strong>Bear</strong> and <strong>IA Writer</strong> try out something like this, though. Bear already has a similar style of linking to other notes and IA Writer’s <a href=\"https://ia.net/writer/support/general/content-blocks\">content blocks</a> seem like a natural fit for this sort of functionality. </p>\n\n<p>It’s clear that, even in the 21st century, note taking is still evolving. For a information hoarder like me, that’s a good thing, even if I don’t love every solution that is created. </p>\n",

The covers, like the lyrics to their songs, felt a bit like they were part of some in-joke that you could only hope to be cool or erudite enough to get. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>\n<!-- /wp:media-text -->\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img src=\"http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2020/ba1f1da454.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1301\" /></figure>\n<figcaption>Truman's Water - Spasm Smash</figcaption>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As far as I know, all of the albums by Truman's Water had collages as the covers. Dig the Eddie Munster cutout on <em>Spasm Smash</em>, the first wonderfully chaotic album I owned by them. Truman’s Water tore through this album with all sorts of noisy alternate tunings and half shout/half screams. The drones they produced in-between the freak outs sounded completely unnatural in a way that kept the listener off-balance and wondering what was going to happen next. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>\n<!-- /wp:media-text -->\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img src=\"http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2020/a17c12e963.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1305\" /></figure>\n<figcaption>Sebadoh - Smash Your Head On The Punk Rock</figcaption>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is another album where the dense collage elements of the cover match the musical contents found within. The edges of <em>Smash Your Head On The Punk Rock</em> were sharp and half-clipped. Soft ruminations on love gave way to nearly impenetrable walls of noise. Temperamental wild-card Eric Gaffney’s off-kilter compositions made this album seem even more like a mashed together bunch of disparate visions. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>\n<!-- /wp:media-text -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Kleon’s zines have revived good memories of those albums and rekindled my interest in the cut and paste format. For my first effort in the style of his single paper zines, I’ve decided to focus a bit on gratitude. Instead of asking people simply how they are doing with the changes that have been brought by the Coronavirus, I’m making a habit of what good things have come out of this semi-lockdown. I’m focused on the things I’m grateful for in broad strokes. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[1318,1319,1320,1321]} -->\n<figure><img src=\"http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2020/643095d3ec.jpg\" data-id=\"1318\" class=\"wp-image-1318\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2020/574429956c.jpg\" data-id=\"1319\" class=\"wp-image-1319\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2020/e377eacfb4.jpg\" data-id=\"1320\" class=\"wp-image-1320\" /></figure>\n <figure>\n <img src=\"http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2020/7437dfb021.jpg\" data-id=\"1321\" class=\"wp-image-1321\" /></figure></li></ul><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption\">A gratitude zine</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m very much enjoying seeing what creative endeavors people are undertaking during this time, as well as what is holding their appreciation. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

It is, however, a moment to recognize that the world is never truly “safe” and waiting until it has achieved that status is likely to keep you from, as Morrissey would say, “doing all the things in life you’d like to.” We can shelter in place and still remain committed to learning, creating and expressing.\n",

				"content_text": "Andy Nicolaides from The Dent <a href=\"https://thedent.net/look-forward/\">has a post</a> about continuing to care about things that may seem inconsequential during these times of isolation and illness. He emphasizes that it’s okay to look forward.\n<blockquote>If any of you reading this have been thinking there’s no point in starting that new podcast you’ve had on your mind for a while, or writing a blog post about how much you like that one episode of Star Trek, or whatever, I ask you to reconsider. Create, joke, play, discuss, speculate, enjoy, love, write, record, laugh. You don’t know who’s day you may brighten with whatever it is you put out there. At the very least, <em>you</em> will enjoy it and that should always take priority.\n\n</blockquote>For his part, Nicolaides will still continue to share his passion for new Apple gadgets at The Dent. I’m going to continue to post interesting things I find from around the interwebs, and they may or may not be related to a certain virus that shall not be named (certainly not by point of origin, as is the habit of some sinister villains).\n\nIncidentally, if you are interested in starting a new podcast, Micro.blog is offering <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2020/03/15/free-microcasting-through.html\">free microcast hosting</a> with their standard hosting plan for the month of April.\n",

The latest blow is that Amazon <a href=\"https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/03/amazon-vinyl-coronavirus/\">will stop stocking records</a> in order to retain shelf space for more critical products during the Coronavirus pandemic.\n<blockquote>“We are seeing increased online shopping, and as a result some products such as household staples and medical supplies are out of stock,” Amazon said in a statement to third-party sellers this week (via <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/music/news/record-labels-take-hit-amazon-stops-accepting-new-physical-media-1203537569/\">Variety</a> ). “With this in mind, we are temporarily prioritizing household staples, medical supplies, and other high-demand products coming into our fulfillment centers so that we can more quickly receive, restock, and deliver these products to customers. For products other than these, we have temporarily disabled shipment creation. … We understand this is a change for our selling partners and appreciate their understanding as we temporarily prioritize these products for customers.”\n\n</blockquote>Amazon sells a quarter of the records purchased in the U.S. Vinyl sales were up 19% in 2019. In addition to the Amazon decision, with people venturing out less to physical retailers, the overall sale of records is likely to drop quite a bit this year.\n",

The idea at the time was for Disney to acquire Twitter to help modernize its distribution, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/style/disney-bob-iger-book.html\">The New York Times</a> reports.

Around the same time as the revelation about the Disney purchase, Tim Challies <a href=\"https://www.challies.com/articles/on-being-a-kwitter/\">wrote about “becoming a Kwitter.”</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the top of the list is the simple reality that I may have the wrong disposition for Twitter. The man just doesn’t fit the medium. Over the past few years I’ve awakened to the reality that in many ways I am a weak person. I am weak physically, constitutionally, and in some ways emotionally. Especially, I’ve learned that I am easily fatigued, drained, or discouraged when involved in unnecessary conflict or even when witnessing it. If my unsanctified disposition is toward cowardice and running away, I believe my sanctified disposition is toward peace and peacemaking. Yet Twitter is a medium that seems to generate conflict and to thrive upon it. I find it a discouraging and intimidating place to be. I derive negligible pleasure from it. It adds nothing necessary to my life and very little that’s truly beneficial. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can relate to the admission of being weak in some ways and though I’m not usually conflict averse IRL, I see online conflict as mostly unproductive. Rarely do hostile exchanges result in changed minds or reconciliation. On a platform like Twitter, it can also feel like conflict can be unexpected and especially intrusive. </p>\n\n<p>I was caught off guard by this aspect of the platform one Sunday a couple of years ago when I quoted something that I had read in a popular newsletter and liked and with which I identified. I tweeted the quote with attribution. I did find the quote on a Twitter but I couldn’t use the retweet or quote features because the original tweet had some additional comments that didn’t really add context. So I used the good old copy and paste and throw some quotes around the copied text method. I then added “(x Twitter handle) has said:.” Pretty simple, right? </p>\n\n<p>After the tweet, I quickly started receiving multiple replies from the original author of the quote. She said that the statement was made in a private conversation with friends of which I was not a part. She said the way I worded the quote was “creepy,” even though I had just copied and pasted what she wrote in a public tweet. I apologized for using the quote and let her know it had resonated with me. She cooled down a bit but still remained fairly defensive, sending me more tweets before letting it settle. I had to teach a confirmation class at church that morning and the whole exchange really rattled me. In fact, it really weighed on me that whole week. </p>\n\n<p>To give the original author of the tweet the benefit of the doubt would be to guess that she had been the victim of some sort of trolling on Twitter previously. To immediately assume that this is not only a very real possibility, but in all likelihood, a probability, is to be ready to accept the malignancy that pervades the social media platform. The ubiquitousness of the clap backs and the quote slams would cause almost anyone to put their shields up. Even the normally mild-mannered seem to turn into battle-hardened pugilists armed with 280 characters on Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, in one sense, the popular social media platform is simply emblematic of the problems posed in the broader internet. Twitter can just be a condensed microcosm of the troubling trends that pervade human interactions online. </p>\n\n<p>Jonas Ellison, <a href=\"https://feedbin.com/entries/f0031f6b5bd6f709a25227b89a7d1cf727ec9236/newsletter\">muses about the internet more generally</a>, in his newsletter.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I see the internet as a giant omnipresent digital mirror. Since its inception, it’s been showing us a lot (!) about humanity. Like those magnified mirrors equipped with bright halogen lights that reveal all the blemishes, knicks, moles, freckles, scars, and discolorment in our faces - we’re seeing more than we were meant to ever see in normal daylight. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those unflattering lights seem particularly strong in Twitter’s corner of the Internet. </p>\n\n<p>After the incident I described, I changed my account settings to use protected tweets. “Protected” is a great word to use in this context, because I wasn’t really feeling like tweeting was safe. I didn’t need the friction caused by even positive comments and I surely didn’t need strangers tweeting at me that the Rape of Nanjing was a hoax (yep, that actually happened). </p>\n\n<p>I’ve been using the protected tweets feature for about 2 years now. I miss some of the aspects of having public tweets, though. It’s pretty limiting when you can’t tweet a reply to someone who doesn’t follow you, or ask a quick question of a company. Surprising positive engagements can happen along with the negative ones in a public space. I once tweeted a comment on the new Public Enemy album (with no @’s or hashtags) and the producer responded back to me. I do miss those kinds of interactions. Just not enough to expose myself to the red-faced mobs that seems to run Twitter these days. </p>\n\n<p>Now I spend a lot less time on Twitter in general. Most of my tweets are syndicated from a blog aggregation service with actual community guidelines - <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">Micro.blog</a>. I still think the Twitter product itself is very well developed and I miss what it used to be. When I’m on there now, though, I’m dodging true believers on my right and on my left. Let’s face it, Twitter wasn’t created to be a political platform. There is little room for explanation or context. I’m also avoiding tweet storms that would have been blog posts 10 years ago. Plodding through those threads feels a bit like reading a novel written on sticky notes. They are antithetical to the original design and intent of the service. </p>\n\n<p>Twitter has changed a lot over the last few years and it only seems to be slouching towards further decline. These days, there are usually many more edifying ways to spend time online. </p>\n",

Just not enough to expose myself to the red-faced mobs that seems to run Twitter these days.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now I spend a lot less time on Twitter in general. Most of my tweets are syndicated from a blog aggregation service with actual community guidelines - <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">Micro.blog</a>. I still think the Twitter product itself is very well developed and I miss what it used to be. When I’m on there now, though, I’m dodging true believers on my right and on my left. Let’s face it, Twitter wasn’t created to be a political platform. There is little room for explanation or context. I’m also avoiding tweet storms that would have been blog posts 10 years ago. Plodding through those threads feels a bit like reading a novel written on sticky notes. They are antithetical to the original design and intent of the service.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Twitter has changed a lot over the last few years and it only seems to be slouching towards further decline. There are usually much more edifying ways to spend time online.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I’ve owned Green Mind by Dinosaur Jr. on cassette, compact disc and vinyl. Still, when I saw <a href=\"https://www.cherryred.co.uk/product/dinosaur-jr-green-mind-deluxe-expanded-edition-double-gatefold-green-vinyl-lp/\">another colored vinyl version</a> newly available for sale, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t tempted to make a purchase. It’s especially hard to resist that kind of acquisition when you believe that, after the apocalypse, the only currency worth anything will be vinyl records. </p>\n\n<p>The limited edition vinyl game is not for the faint of heart nor the easily discouraged. A rare bundle of reissues came up recently for <a href=\"https://frostedechoes.blog/2019/11/23/movember-starlings/\">another one of my favorite indie-rock bands</a>, and before I even knew about the bundle, it was sold out. </p>\n\n<p>The most frustrating thing about this sort of “you snooze, you lose” situation is that being off Instagram for a few days was what ultimately prevented me from getting the bundle of LP’s. The three LP bundle is sold out, and the only way to get the third record is to buy it off of Discogs for a cool $100. It wouldn’t irritate me as much as it does if it wasn’t a case of a legendary independent record label like Merge Records using a corporate silo owned by Facebook exclusively to advertise their new hotness. There is a news section on the label’s website, but it doesn’t appear to have an RSS feed. </p>\n\n<p>The founders of Merge records are famous for their progressive political activism. However, not even they consider the role that Facebook has played in <a href=\"https://frostedechoes.blog/2019/10/19/chipping-away-at-democracy/\">undermining our democracy</a>. That is a role to which even <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/07/tech/boz-trump-facebook/index.html\">executives at the company now admit</a>. It doesn’t seem like Facebook is a platform a fiercely independent label would want to help amplify. Nor should the label force their fans into those platforms to keep up with new releases. </p>\n",

Surely this is a triumph and yet, it makes me kind of sad when I think about how one doesn't have to search out and find music in traditional ways anymore. Pitchfork and Rolling Stone may still be relevant, but you don't need the encyclopedic knowledge of a music critic to tell you what you might like these days. Plug in some songs you already know you love, and have an algorithm feed you what else you will probably enjoy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It really works, mostly. What the formula probably won't tell you, that you should know, is that \"Pale Blue Eyes\" was the sonic template from which Mazzy Star was birthed. It won't tell you that \"Sex Beat\" by Gun Club created the sound that was heard in many a Pixies song. You might figure some of those things out from recommended \"influencers\" lists, but it will be hard to put together an entire band's catalog from the seed of some forgotten classic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Turning art recommendations into a system is about more than just algorithms, though. If you feel like you just want to unwind, in addition to the \"chill mixes\" that all the streaming services feature, <a href=\"https://link.medium.com/JeV1Vctn92\">neuroscience has found the song that will most relax you</a>. After listening to the song, “Weightless,” by Marconi Union, I can attest to the fact that the song is indeed, incredibly relaxing. They even have a ten hour version. With results this precise, it can be hard to argue with science.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This trend is not limited to music, either. New technology is even going to assess what audiences would like to see on the big screen. <a href=\"https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/warner-bros-ai-choose-films-movies/\">Warner Bros. is planning on letting AI green light their movies</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It works by assessing the “value” of an actor, estimating how much the film could make in theaters or streaming sites, and offering “dollar-figure parameters” for packaging, marketing, and distribution decisions behinds movies.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Human creative choices are not entirely out-of-the-picture, but data drives business decisions.

The onslaught of cheerful Christmas songs, that starts just as the tryptophan induced coma from Thanksgiving wears off, contributes to that way of framing things.

Among only those classified as conservative Republicans, the number of those in favor of more presidential power has doubled in the past year. The fears that this president has promoted the idea of a totalitarian state to his followers seems to have been well founded. That should come as no surprise to those who noted the president’s open affection for dictators, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/05/donald-trump-praises-saddam-hussein-for-killing-terrorists-so-good/\">including those as brutal as Sadam Hussein</a>.</p>\n<p>It appears a certain segment of the population, particularly conservative Republicans, essentially want a king of the United States. This was the state of affairs in ancient Israel, in the time of the prophet Samuel. The prophet warned the people against putting themselves under the yoke of a king. However, the Israelites  had lost faith in God as deliverer and wanted a king to lead them to victory over the Philistines.</p>\n<p>Samuel pleaded with his people to rethink looking for a king to rule them. They were persistent, though, and he brought their request to God.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The LORD answered Samuel, “Comply with the people’s request—everything they ask of you—because they haven’t rejected you. No, they’ve rejected me as king over them.” “They are doing to you only what they’ve been doing to me from the day I brought them out of Egypt to this very minute, abandoning me and worshipping other gods.” “So comply with their request, but give them a clear warning, telling them how the king will rule over them.” <em>(1 Samuel 8:7-9, CEB)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’m assuming that a fair amount of those who want to give unchecked power to the president are from a Judeo-Christian tradition. They, like the ancient Israelites, seemed to have lost their faith in God to protect them against their enemies, real and perceived. Many of the Christians who support the current president believe that a strongman with a desire to rule as a king is necessary to protect their religious traditions. On that subject, Alan Jacobs has <a href=\"https://blog.ayjay.org/the-most-important-public-issue/\">this to say</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For instance: Stretch your mind and imagine a POTUS who supports religious liberty but who also pursues reckless, thoughtless, and inconsistent policies both domestically and abroad. Imagine that he is cruel to the helpless, treacherous to longstanding allies, cozy with authoritarian regimes, incapable of sticking with a plan, prone to judge everyone he meets strictly by their willingness to praise and defer to him. Imagine that he is colossally ignorant of domestic and foreign realities alike and yet convinced of his matchless wisdom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You might, first, ask whether such a President is a reliable ally of religious freedom. Would he work to guarantee liberty of conscience for those who on religious grounds criticized his own policies? Don’t make me laugh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jacobs goes on to question whether self-preservation should be the strongest driver of choosing leaders and public policy. He asks whether Christians who so clearly prioritize their interests over those of others can be considered reliable witnesses for faith in Christ. The Christian faith <strong>explicitly</strong> condemns putting one’s own needs above their neighbors. When asked which is the greatest commandments, Jesus responds in clear terms.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He replied, “You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your being, and with all your mind.” “ This is the first and greatest commandment.” “ And the second is like it: You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.” (Matthew 22:37-39, CEB)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Much has been made of tribalism within the group of Christians who support the current president without reservation. It is evident, by the treatment we have seen of other populations, such as immigrants, that this administration is not concerned about our neighbors. The desire to strengthen the hand of such a leader, to that of a king, speaks of a lack of faith in anything other than despotism.</p>\n",

They were persistent, though, and he brought their request to God.\n\n> The LORD answered Samuel, “Comply with the people’s request—everything they ask of you—because they haven’t rejected you. No, they’ve rejected me as king over them.” “They are doing to you only what they’ve been doing to me from the day I brought them out of Egypt to this very minute, abandoning me and worshipping other gods.” “So comply with their request, but give them a clear warning, telling them how the king will rule over them.” *(1 Samuel 8:7-9, CEB)*\n\nI’m assuming that a fair amount of those who want to give unchecked power to the president are from a Judeo-Christian tradition. They, like the ancient Israelites, seemed to have lost their faith in God to protect them against their enemies, real and perceived. Many of the Christians who support the current president believe that a strongman with a desire to rule as a king is necessary to protect their religious traditions. On that subject, Alan Jacobs has [this to say](https://blog.ayjay.org/the-most-important-public-issue/):\n\n> For instance: Stretch your mind and imagine a POTUS who supports religious liberty but who also pursues reckless, thoughtless, and inconsistent policies both domestically and abroad. Imagine that he is cruel to the helpless, treacherous to longstanding allies, cozy with authoritarian regimes, incapable of sticking with a plan, prone to judge everyone he meets strictly by their willingness to praise and defer to him. Imagine that he is colossally ignorant of domestic and foreign realities alike and yet convinced of his matchless wisdom.\n\n> You might, first, ask whether such a President is a reliable ally of religious freedom. Would he work to guarantee liberty of conscience for those who on religious grounds criticized his own policies? Don’t make me laugh.\n\nJacobs goes on to question whether self-preservation should be the strongest driver of choosing leaders and public policy. He asks whether Christians who so clearly prioritize their interests over those of others can be considered reliable witnesses for faith in Christ. The Christian faith **explicitly** condemns putting one’s own needs above their neighbors. When asked which is the greatest commandments, Jesus responds in clear terms. \n\n> He replied, “You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your being, and with all your mind.” “ This is the first and greatest commandment.” “ And the second is like it: You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.” (Matthew 22:37-39, CEB)\n\nMuch has been made of tribalism within the group of Christians who support the current president without reservation. It is evident, by the treatment we have seen of other populations, such as immigrants, that this administration is not concerned about our neighbors. The desire to strengthen the hand of such a leader, to that of a king, speaks of a lack of faith in anything other than despotism. \n",

				"content_text": "Next week, Instagram is set to begin hiding like counts on posts in the US, according to [this TechCrunch piece](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/08/instagram-hide-likes-us/). The move is expected to hurt influencers on the platform, as initial tests in other countries showed that likes on posts went down when the counts were not displayed. The influencer economy is supposed to be a big part of what drives the platform.  The speculation is that anything that hurts those influencers and their ability to use Instagram to build their businesses too badly will be rolled back.\n\nI'm not completely bought into the idea that influencers are as strong a driver of engagement on Instagram as they are assumed to be, but to be fair, I haven't looked deeply at the data. However, I know that the move will be good for teenagers who view posts as popularity contests and delete photos when they don't achieve a certain like count, for fear of embarrassment. I appreciate the fact that those who are steering the Instagram ship are taking steps that account for the mental health of its users. \n\n\n",

How one state can reconcile boycotting another state over bathrooms while seriously restricting the right to protest, say, people’s houses being bulldozed in <em>another country</em>, I’m not sure I will ever understand. This all happening under the auspices of a constitution that guarantees the right to free speech makes everything even more ridiculous.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"taking-a-bite-out-of-apple\">Taking a bite out of Apple</h3>\n<p>Returning to the issue of uneven corporate activism, it starts to get difficult to determine exactly what a conscientious consumer is to make of his or her options. Picking up with Alan Jacobs again, who <a href=\"https://blog.ayjay.org/ethical-evaluation/\">has a post</a> that wrestles with how to handle the ethical implications of Apple’s decisions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The other axis, that of ethics, is even more difficult. Apple’s Chinese entanglements massive compromise the ethical status of the company, and in more than one way. (Which is worse, obedience to the demands of the Chinese government or the exploitation of Chinese labor?) But Apple also deserves some praise for its commitment to privacy and its truly wonderful work  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqoXFCCTfm4\">in making its computers accessible to a wide range of users</a>. I don’t know how to make an ethics spreadsheet, as it were, that assembles all the relevant factors — including comparisons to the available alternatives — and gives them proper weighting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I believe that Apple is a particularly tough case here, because in so many areas (tablets, for example), there are simply no credible competitors. That’s not meant to be a commentary simply on the Apple products themselves, but also upon the ecosystem that exists around them. There is a very real paucity of third party software on other platforms, mostly because people using Android and Windows don’t tend to be software enthusiasts, who are willing to pay for well done products by independent shops.</p>\n<p>My wife asked a good question regarding Apple, as we shopped for a new tablet that she can use for work: <em>“How do you hold them to account, when your power is your purchasing power?”</em></p>\n",

The state of New York joined the NBA in boycotting North Carolina over bathroom provisioning, while also almost simultaneously [making is just short of illegal to boycott other countries](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2017/03/09/new-york-senate-passes-anti-bds-bills) for human rights violations.  How one state can reconcile boycotting another state over bathrooms while seriously restricting the right to protest, say, people’s houses being bulldozed in *another country*, I’m not sure I will ever understand. This all happening under the auspices of a constitution that guarantees the right to free speech makes everything even more ridiculous. \n\n<br>\n\n### Taking a bite out of Apple\n\nReturning to the issue of uneven corporate activism, it starts to get difficult to determine exactly what a conscientious consumer is to make of his or her options. Picking up with Alan Jacobs again, who [has a post](https://blog.ayjay.org/ethical-evaluation/) that wrestles with how to handle the ethical implications of Apple’s decisions. \n\n> The other axis, that of ethics, is even more difficult. Apple’s Chinese entanglements massive compromise the ethical status of the company, and in more than one way. (Which is worse, obedience to the demands of the Chinese government or the exploitation of Chinese labor?) But Apple also deserves some praise for its commitment to privacy and its truly wonderful work  [in making its computers accessible to a wide range of users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqoXFCCTfm4). I don’t know how to make an ethics spreadsheet, as it were, that assembles all the relevant factors — including comparisons to the available alternatives — and gives them proper weighting.  \n\nI believe that Apple is a particularly tough case here, because in so many areas (tablets, for example), there are simply no credible competitors. That’s not meant to be a commentary simply on the Apple products themselves, but also upon the ecosystem that exists around them. There is a very real paucity of third party software on other platforms, mostly because people using Android and Windows don’t tend to be software enthusiasts, who are willing to pay for well done products by independent shops. \n\nMy wife asked a good question regarding Apple, as we shopped for a new tablet that she can use for work: *“How do you hold them to account, when your power is your purchasing power?”*\n",

On one hand, it’s without question the best of the major US sports to watch on television. On the other, it’s an absolutely barbaric sport. Many of the players playing today will suffer injuries playing the game which they will never recover from. And many of the people who are supposed to be in charge of the league are seemingly immoral. It’s perhaps not as bad as watching boxing in decades past. Or actual gladiators in centuries past. But it’s also not entirely different.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, in my view, too many people (my son included) are making the same choice that Siegler ultimately makes, which is to throw out any misgivings and just keep on watching.</p>\n<p>I think Augustine would have agreed with the gladiator reference. He writes the following, of his friend Alypius, in the sixth book of his <em>Confessions</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He, not forsaking that secular course which his parents had charmed him to pursue, had gone before me to Rome, to study law, and there he was carried away incredibly with an incredible eagerness after the shows of gladiators. For being utterly averse to and detesting such spectacles, he was one day by chance met by divers of his acquaintance and fellow-students coming from dinner, and they with a familiar violence haled him, vehemently refusing and resisting, into the Amphitheatre, during these cruel and deadly shows, he thus protesting: “Though you hale my body to that place, and there set me, can you force me also to turn my mind or my eyes to those shows? I shall then be absent while present, and so shall overcome both you and them.” They hearing this, led him on nevertheless, desirous perchance to try that very thing, whether he could do as he said. When they were come thither, and had taken their places as they could, the whole place kindled with that savage pastime. But he, closing the passages of his eyes, forbade his mind to range abroad after such evils; and would he had stopped his ears also! For in the fight, when one fell, a mighty cry of the whole people striking him strongly, overcome by curiosity, and as if prepared to despise and be superior to it whatsoever it were, even when seen, he opened his eyes, and was stricken with a deeper wound in his soul than the other, whom he desired to behold, was in his body; and he fell more miserably than he upon whose fall that mighty noise was raised, which entered through his ears, and unlocked his eyes, to make way for the striking and beating down of a soul, bold rather than resolute, and the weaker, in that it had presumed on itself, which ought to have relied on Thee. For so soon as he saw that blood, he therewith drunk down savageness; nor turned away, but fixed his eye, drinking in frenzy, unawares, and was delighted with that guilty fight, and intoxicated with the bloody pastime. Nor was he now the man he came, but one of the throng he came unto, yea, a true associate of theirs that brought him thither.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

Many of the players playing today will suffer injuries playing the game which they will never recover from. And many of the people who are supposed to be in charge of the league are seemingly immoral. It’s perhaps not as bad as watching boxing in decades past. Or actual gladiators in centuries past. But it’s also not entirely different. \n\nUnfortunately, in my view, too many people (my son included) are making the same choice that Siegler ultimately makes, which is to throw out any misgivings and just keep on watching. \n\nI think Augustine would have agreed with the gladiator reference. He writes the following, of his friend Alypius, in the sixth book of his *Confessions*. \n\n> He, not forsaking that secular course which his parents had charmed him to pursue, had gone before me to Rome, to study law, and there he was carried away incredibly with an incredible eagerness after the shows of gladiators. For being utterly averse to and detesting such spectacles, he was one day by chance met by divers of his acquaintance and fellow-students coming from dinner, and they with a familiar violence haled him, vehemently refusing and resisting, into the Amphitheatre, during these cruel and deadly shows, he thus protesting: “Though you hale my body to that place, and there set me, can you force me also to turn my mind or my eyes to those shows? I shall then be absent while present, and so shall overcome both you and them.” They hearing this, led him on nevertheless, desirous perchance to try that very thing, whether he could do as he said. When they were come thither, and had taken their places as they could, the whole place kindled with that savage pastime. But he, closing the passages of his eyes, forbade his mind to range abroad after such evils; and would he had stopped his ears also! For in the fight, when one fell, a mighty cry of the whole people striking him strongly, overcome by curiosity, and as if prepared to despise and be superior to it whatsoever it were, even when seen, he opened his eyes, and was stricken with a deeper wound in his soul than the other, whom he desired to behold, was in his body; and he fell more miserably than he upon whose fall that mighty noise was raised, which entered through his ears, and unlocked his eyes, to make way for the striking and beating down of a soul, bold rather than resolute, and the weaker, in that it had presumed on itself, which ought to have relied on Thee. For so soon as he saw that blood, he therewith drunk down savageness; nor turned away, but fixed his eye, drinking in frenzy, unawares, and was delighted with that guilty fight, and intoxicated with the bloody pastime. Nor was he now the man he came, but one of the throng he came unto, yea, a true associate of theirs that brought him thither.\n",

It is an object of reverence. Devotion to it precludes interruption with the sacrifices it entails. Like most gods, it does what it will, and cannot be questioned.

However, we can’t list the meeting in our church bulletin, without changing the name. To admit that you are following Christian teaching, even when it goes against a love for unrestricted access to guns, is to commit a uniquely American heresy. To further illustrate the point, Mom’s Demand Action advocates for safety measures that were first developed by the National Rifle Association in the 1980’s.

One of the most visceral scenes I have ever read in a novel comes from <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1290\">Salammbo, by Gustave Flaubert</a>. In the book, the citizens of the ancient city of Carthage are trying stave off invasion by the angry and unpaid mercenaries who helped them to fight against the Roman Empire. The water supply to the city has been cut and they are in dire need of rain. In their desperation, the Carthaginians hastily sacrifice their children to the fires of a giant idol of Moloch.

He ever wished for more. In order to furnish him with a larger supply, the victims were piled up on his hands with a big chain above them which kept them in their place. Some devout persons had at the beginning wished to count them, to see whether their number corresponded with the days of the solar year; but others were brought, and it was impossible to distinguish them in the giddy motion of the horrible arms. This lasted for a long, indefinite time until the evening. Then the partitions inside assumed a darker glow, and burning flesh could be seen. Some even believed that they could descry hair, limbs, and whole bodies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After the Sandy Hook shootings, there was a lack of legislative, or really any, action that followed. Many said that if we allowed this sort of thing to happen to our children without doing anything about it, we would never have the will to prevent these things.

But I wish that the audiences and creators of these shows would give a little extra thought to how the dead woman (because it’s almost always a woman) at the heart of the story is treated in the telling. Is she treated like a human being who had more life left to live, with people who loved her, who will never be the same because of her loss? Or is she reduced to a gory crime scene photo and a plot point in a story about a man who doesn’t deserve anyone’s fascination?  \n",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2019/8033113433.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>I started the year 2019 with another respectable bullet journal (bujo), crafted from a Moleskine notebook and made to get things done.</strong> Something went awry along the way to filling that notebook, though.</p>\n<p>The problems begin when I realized, as in other years, I was going to have far less tasks than notebook. Something seemed slightly tragic about having a perfectly good notebook with so much space going to waste. The bullet journal system doesn&rsquo;t encourage traditional journaling, so much as it does creating action items and systems to develop habits. Sure, it has built-in support for plain notes, but those feel like they are mostly to be used in conjunction with bullets for actions. With more in my head than just what task I needed to accomplish next, I began to explore more traditional journal entries that in years past might have been done in a digital format such as the <a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com/\">Day One app</a>.</p>\n<p>I have systems in place to limit my screen time after 9pm, which has proven to be a good thing, so it made more sense to be writing journal entries on good old-fashioned paper. I started off slow, at first. Then, as difficulties in my everyday life mounted, the journal entries became more frequent. Those entries outnumbered the action item bullets. I tend to find that, for me, the notion of productivity for its own sake goes right out of the window in the face of medical problems and unexpected life disruptions. My incomplete todo&rsquo;s from March still look at me and laugh from the page. The best laid plans (well, maybe not the best) of mice and men&hellip;</p>\n<p>In fact, it would be pretty easy to look at my journal and determine when introspection became more important than productivity.

				"content_text": "![](https://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2019/8033113433.jpg)  \n\n**I started the year 2019 with another respectable bullet journal (bujo), crafted from a Moleskine notebook and made to get things done.** Something went awry along the way to filling that notebook, though. \n\nThe problems begin when I realized, as in other years, I was going to have far less tasks than notebook. Something seemed slightly tragic about having a perfectly good notebook with so much space going to waste. The bullet journal system doesn't encourage traditional journaling, so much as it does creating action items and systems to develop habits. Sure, it has built-in support for plain notes, but those feel like they are mostly to be used in conjunction with bullets for actions. With more in my head than just what task I needed to accomplish next, I began to explore more traditional journal entries that in years past might have been done in a digital format such as the [Day One app](https://dayoneapp.com/). \n\nI have systems in place to limit my screen time after 9pm, which has proven to be a good thing, so it made more sense to be writing journal entries on good old-fashioned paper. I started off slow, at first. Then, as difficulties in my everyday life mounted, the journal entries became more frequent. Those entries outnumbered the action item bullets. I tend to find that, for me, the notion of productivity for its own sake goes right out of the window in the face of medical problems and unexpected life disruptions. My incomplete todo's from March still look at me and laugh from the page. The best laid plans (well, maybe not the best) of mice and men...\n\nIn fact, it would be pretty easy to look at my journal and determine when introspection became more important than productivity. Gauging how each day was going, whether things were improving and reflecting on overcoming past difficulties took priority over tallying up a list of things I was getting done. It happens. Life occasionally gets in the way of progress and sometimes taking a step back to reflect is more necessary than moving forward on the next goal. Sometimes moving forward is not even possible without that act of reflection. Other times, with various things competing for time and mental energy, forward progress is not even  possible until a later, more stable, time. \n\nAs I fill my Moleskine, I’m trying to stay mindful of the rightful place of productivity in my thinking, in my life and even in my bujo.

With no up-front investment, an artist or label can create a vinyl campaign and start taking orders almost immediately. Once they reach their minimum goal, we press their records and ship them to their fans.\n\nFor bands that can't take the risk of pressing records without knowing the level of interest, this provides them a safe way to test the waters and give the fans what they want. \n\nThis is another reason I consider Bandcamp to be a tremendously valuable service and an innovator in a time of a lot of upheaval in the music industry. \n\n(Of course, [sold out prereleases](https://toothandnailrecords.merchnow.com/products/v2/289803/young-in-my-head-old-blood-lp--dd) are a completely separate problem.) \n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><img src=\"http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2019/2390c002d0.jpg\" alt=\"Micro.blog vs. Tumblr\"></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>A lot of people these days are worried about the demise of Tumblr. The product has changed hands a few times, and neither its Yahoo! parents or its Verizon parents seem to have paid much attention to it. M.G. Siegler <a href=\"https://500ish.com/tumblr-too-929b7d359221\">took his concerns to his Medium blog</a>, 500ish Words. In the post, he evaluates the current alternatives to Tumblr. What is most interesting, to me, is his quick dismissal of Micro.blog, the platform that hosts this blog. He writes, “And other things such as the newer  <a href=\"https://micro.blog/?utm_campaign=First%20Draught&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">Micro.blog</a> are almost too spartan.”</p>\n<p>Micro.blog started out fairly limited, but has steadily built on a solid foundation. Truthfully, that’s the way most software developers believe products should iterate. The rate of iteration for Micro.blog has been fairly aggressive lately. So while I might have agreed with Siegler a little more than a week ago, when his post was written, I no longer do. In the past week, <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2019/01/30/custom-templates-categories.html\">Micro.blog rolled out major improvements</a> that put it on par with Tumblr for personal blog hosting.</p>\n<p>The most important of the new improvements was a most from being built on Jekyll to being built on Hugo, and with that, the inclusion of the ability to customize the design of your blog. This in itself is a huge step for Micro.blog, which previously allowed very limited customization options such as simple CSS overrides and footer design. Now blog owners are free to customize their entire themes, as well as share those customized themes with others on GitHub.</p>\n<p>One ancillary benefit to the switch to Hugo, though, which I haven’t seen anyone on M.b. mention yet, is the ability to use Hugo shortcodes. Shortcodes elegantly allow for embedded content, the thing for which Tumblr is perhaps best known. They do so in a minimal way that fits in nicely with the markdown language that powers posts on Micro.blog. Previously, you could use embedded content on Micro.blog but it was not guaranteed to be responsive (a limitation of the Jekyll backend). Sure, you could embed a YouTube video, but switch to a mobile device and that thing would go right off the page. To properly handle embeds such as YouTube videos in Jekyll, you would have to install a plugin, something that wasn’t supported by Micro.blog. Even on Jekyll’s preferred hosting site, GitHub Pages, you would have to use <a href=\"https://github.com/nathancy/jekyll-embed-video\">a solution like this</a>. In other words, such a common blogging use case as YouTube embeds was pretty challenging on the Jekyll platform. Now, many popular embeds (YouTube, Vimeo, Twitter and Instagram) are supported in Micro.blog by using Hugo shortcodes.</p>\n<p>This may sound surprising, but In some ways, the new Micro.blog platform is actually <em>superior</em> to Tumblr when it comes to embeds. I say this as a formerly frustrated Tumblr user. I wanted to use a professionally designed Tumblr theme, but what I discovered was that embeds would behave differently on the front end of my blog than they would in the Tumblr dashboard. Some sites, such as Bandcamp, offer Tumblr-specific embedding options. Those options make the content appear correctly if you are a Tumblr user viewing it in the dashboard or if the blog is using the default theme. If you are using another theme, all bets are off for the majority of your viewers who are seeing the content in the front end of your blog. However, if you use standard embed codes, the content will probably look right on the front end of your custom theme, but it usually wouldn’t appear correctly in the Tumblr dashboard. This inconsistency caused me much consternation when I was an active Tumblr user. With a more standard set of embedding capabilities, Hugo and now Micro.blog provide a more consistent visual experience.</p>\n<p>In his piece, Siegler also speculates on what a more contemporary Tumblr would look like.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s hard to know what a more modern Tumblr would look like — it would undoubtedly be mobile-first, but would it be better as a paid product these days? One major issue Tumblr had was a complete and utter failure to monetize. Ads seemed like a straightforward proposition, perhaps in a way similar to how they work on Instagram now. But for whatever reason, they never truly worked on Tumblr.</p>\n<p>Could it be a right place/right time thing for a paid social network, truly free from advertising?  <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facts-about-facebook-11548374613\">There are certainly signs</a> . Such a product would never get to Facebook-scale, of course. But it wouldn’t have to. And actually, shouldn’t aspire to. That never seemed to be the success state for Tumblr anyway.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Micro.blog is also close to what Siegler proposes as a “paid social network, truly free from advertising.” The social component that glues blogs together is actually free, but participated in most fully by using a Micro.blog paid, hosted account. Like the paid version of Tumblr that Siegler imagines, it will never get to Facebook scale, but it doesn’t need to in order to be compelling. The people who are using the platform are there because they are invested in it.

				"content_text": "<br>\n\n![Micro.blog vs. Tumblr](http://rcrackley.micro.blog/uploads/2019/2390c002d0.jpg)\n\n<br>\n\n\nA lot of people these days are worried about the demise of Tumblr. The product has changed hands a few times, and neither its Yahoo! parents or its Verizon parents seem to have paid much attention to it. M.G. Siegler [took his concerns to his Medium blog](https://500ish.com/tumblr-too-929b7d359221), 500ish Words. In the post, he evaluates the current alternatives to Tumblr. What is most interesting, to me, is his quick dismissal of Micro.blog, the platform that hosts this blog. He writes, “And other things such as the newer  [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/?utm_campaign=First%20Draught&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) are almost too spartan.”\n\nMicro.blog started out fairly limited, but has steadily built on a solid foundation. Truthfully, that’s the way most software developers believe products should iterate. The rate of iteration for Micro.blog has been fairly aggressive lately. So while I might have agreed with Siegler a little more than a week ago, when his post was written, I no longer do. In the past week, [Micro.blog rolled out major improvements](https://www.manton.org/2019/01/30/custom-templates-categories.html) that put it on par with Tumblr for personal blog hosting. \n\nThe most important of the new improvements was a most from being built on Jekyll to being built on Hugo, and with that, the inclusion of the ability to customize the design of your blog. This in itself is a huge step for Micro.blog, which previously allowed very limited customization options such as simple CSS overrides and footer design. Now blog owners are free to customize their entire themes, as well as share those customized themes with others on GitHub. \n\nOne ancillary benefit to the switch to Hugo, though, which I haven’t seen anyone on M.b. mention yet, is the ability to use Hugo shortcodes. Shortcodes elegantly allow for embedded content, the thing for which Tumblr is perhaps best known. They do so in a minimal way that fits in nicely with the markdown language that powers posts on Micro.blog. Previously, you could use embedded content on Micro.blog but it was not guaranteed to be responsive (a limitation of the Jekyll backend). Sure, you could embed a YouTube video, but switch to a mobile device and that thing would go right off the page. To properly handle embeds such as YouTube videos in Jekyll, you would have to install a plugin, something that wasn’t supported by Micro.blog. Even on Jekyll’s preferred hosting site, GitHub Pages, you would have to use [a solution like this](https://github.com/nathancy/jekyll-embed-video). In other words, such a common blogging use case as YouTube embeds was pretty challenging on the Jekyll platform. Now, many popular embeds (YouTube, Vimeo, Twitter and Instagram) are supported in Micro.blog by using Hugo shortcodes. \n\nThis may sound surprising, but In some ways, the new Micro.blog platform is actually *superior* to Tumblr when it comes to embeds. I say this as a formerly frustrated Tumblr user. I wanted to use a professionally designed Tumblr theme, but what I discovered was that embeds would behave differently on the front end of my blog than they would in the Tumblr dashboard. Some sites, such as Bandcamp, offer Tumblr-specific embedding options. Those options make the content appear correctly if you are a Tumblr user viewing it in the dashboard or if the blog is using the default theme. If you are using another theme, all bets are off for the majority of your viewers who are seeing the content in the front end of your blog. However, if you use standard embed codes, the content will probably look right on the front end of your custom theme, but it usually wouldn’t appear correctly in the Tumblr dashboard. This inconsistency caused me much consternation when I was an active Tumblr user. With a more standard set of embedding capabilities, Hugo and now Micro.blog provide a more consistent visual experience. \n\nIn his piece, Siegler also speculates on what a more contemporary Tumblr would look like. \n\n> It’s hard to know what a more modern Tumblr would look like — it would undoubtedly be mobile-first, but would it be better as a paid product these days? One major issue Tumblr had was a complete and utter failure to monetize. Ads seemed like a straightforward proposition, perhaps in a way similar to how they work on Instagram now. But for whatever reason, they never truly worked on Tumblr.  \n>   \n> Could it be a right place/right time thing for a paid social network, truly free from advertising?  [There are certainly signs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facts-about-facebook-11548374613) . Such a product would never get to Facebook-scale, of course. But it wouldn’t have to. And actually, shouldn’t aspire to. That never seemed to be the success state for Tumblr anyway.  \n\nMicro.blog is also close to what Siegler proposes as a “paid social network, truly free from advertising.” The social component that glues blogs together is actually free, but participated in most fully by using a Micro.blog paid, hosted account. Like the paid version of Tumblr that Siegler imagines, it will never get to Facebook scale, but it doesn’t need to in order to be compelling. The people who are using the platform are there because they are invested in it. The deliberate nature of the participation elevates the level of discourse in a way that isn’t, in my experience, matched on Tumblr. Not to mention that on Micro.blog, you don’t have to see repeated ads for situational teen sex games. Most months, that alone seems worth a few bucks. \n\n\n\n\n",

That is only the tip of the iceberg. “Someone will write a book about this,” an Oregon official says in footage that appears in episode one, “and I will guarantee you when that book comes out, people will say that it’s fiction.” In the ’80s, he couldn’t have imagined Netflix, or anticipated a docuseries like this one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s easy to see why a show including all of those elements would make for incredibly compelling television.

Each of the sides have their talking heads that are allowed plenty of screen time to comment on the various events that took place when Baghwan Shree Rajneesh and his followers moved onto a 60,000 acre ranch next to rural Antelope, OR.

The purposeful displays of opulence that the guru engages in run counter to the teachings of most religions about how spiritual leaders are supposed to live. When people in both the East and the West picture a spiritual leader, we see asceticism the kind of which was eschewed by Rajneesh. Also troublesome is the free love version of human sexuality to which the group subscribed. Its opposition to traditional marriage and the aspirational narcissism of a relentless pursuit for individual enlightenment raises serious concerns about how children were raised.

It’s not hard to imagine that the group of Rajneeshees might have been fairly harmless to its neighbors, had their presence been merely tolerated and not opposed outright. Most of the incidences of aggression or even suggested violence were responses to the US government or citizens blocking activities that were initiated by the group.

I do, however, have a practice that I have used and want to share about managing bedtime. Specifically, how you can manage devices when it’s time to go to sleep and how you disconnect.</p>\n<p>I recently implemented a Disney Circle device, which allows you to manage wifi devices and usage profiles for each individual in your house. With the circle, I can manage how much internet time my kids get each day and can apply even more granularity to the usage of things like the major social networks. Fortunately, my kids haven’t gotten to the stage where they have a desire to use the social networks. I’ll enjoy that for as long as it can hold.</p>\n<p>The Circle is not only for the benefit of my children, though. It also helps my wife and I to maintain more healthy internet habits. I spend too much of my life looking at a computer screen during the day in a building leased from Red Hat. I need to detach from the screen at some point during the course of evening. Or be forced to do so, if necessary. That is where the Circle comes in. I used to have my WiFi router set to turn off at 9pm, but that became problematic when I my wife and I were watching something on Netflix and it ran just a little bit longer than we expected. Enter the Circle, with its device or user-specific settings. I am now able to restrict only our mobile devices at 9pm (7:30 pm for the little guys) and I don’t have to worry about the Apple TV.</p>\n<p>One thing I like about this method is that I don’t have to put away my device completely. I happily read articles that are saved to Pocket on my iPad, for instance. The difference, though, is I’m much more focused and intentional and there are bounds to my consumption. Once I’ve read the articles I’ve saved, that’s it. There are no opportunities to go down a hyperlinked rathole. I’m not going to find myself scrolling down an infinite list of Instagram picks that are curated by a machine to appeal to me. I won’t get engaged in some Twitter rant thread and go to bed angry.</p>\n<p>At the risk of overstating the point, how you manage your internet access can have a major impact on your life and your relationships. With so much work having gone into making your device seem like the best way to spend your limited attention, most people need some kind of barrier to overuse. I recently talked to a friend who had been battling with his wife over his child’s YouTube usage. His wife made the point that they needed to rely on the child to curb his own internet usage. To expect an 11-year-old to have the necessary willpower to combat the tricks and techniques of the technology industry is too much. Adults have a hard enough time with technology withdrawal, and kids are especially vulnerable. Ultimately, it’s best to have some kind of system in place to prevent excessive internet exposure.</p>\n<p>One thing to note is that the Circle is not a truly end-to-end solution for device management. It can only control internet access through wifi. So, if your kids (or you) are overindulging on games, and those games do not require a constant internet connection, you have to find another solution to keep that behavior in check.</p>\n<p><em>Collage using work from <a href=\"https://duncan.co/\">Duncan Rawlinson</a> and Derek Liang</em></p>\n",

With the circle, I can manage how much internet time my kids get each day and can apply even more granularity to the usage of things like the major social networks. Fortunately, my kids haven’t gotten to the stage where they have a desire to use the social networks. I’ll enjoy that for as long as it can hold. \n\nThe Circle is not only for the benefit of my children, though. It also helps my wife and I to maintain more healthy internet habits. I spend too much of my life looking at a computer screen during the day in a building leased from Red Hat. I need to detach from the screen at some point during the course of evening. Or be forced to do so, if necessary. That is where the Circle comes in. I used to have my WiFi router set to turn off at 9pm, but that became problematic when I my wife and I were watching something on Netflix and it ran just a little bit longer than we expected. Enter the Circle, with its device or user-specific settings. I am now able to restrict only our mobile devices at 9pm (7:30 pm for the little guys) and I don’t have to worry about the Apple TV.\n\nOne thing I like about this method is that I don’t have to put away my device completely. I happily read articles that are saved to Pocket on my iPad, for instance. The difference, though, is I’m much more focused and intentional and there are bounds to my consumption. Once I’ve read the articles I’ve saved, that’s it. There are no opportunities to go down a hyperlinked rathole. I’m not going to find myself scrolling down an infinite list of Instagram picks that are curated by a machine to appeal to me. I won’t get engaged in some Twitter rant thread and go to bed angry. \n\nAt the risk of overstating the point, how you manage your internet access can have a major impact on your life and your relationships. With so much work having gone into making your device seem like the best way to spend your limited attention, most people need some kind of barrier to overuse. I recently talked to a friend who had been battling with his wife over his child’s YouTube usage. His wife made the point that they needed to rely on the child to curb his own internet usage. To expect an 11-year-old to have the necessary willpower to combat the tricks and techniques of the technology industry is too much. Adults have a hard enough time with technology withdrawal, and kids are especially vulnerable. Ultimately, it’s best to have some kind of system in place to prevent excessive internet exposure.\n\nOne thing to note is that the Circle is not a truly end-to-end solution for device management. It can only control internet access through wifi. So, if your kids (or you) are overindulging on games, and those games do not require a constant internet connection, you have to find another solution to keep that behavior in check. \n\n*Collage using work from [Duncan Rawlinson](https://duncan.co/) and Derek Liang*\n",

Odessey isn’t a brand new experience, but rather builds upon its predecessor in innovative ways.\n\nWhat interests me about the Alto’s franchise is how people use the games in a therapeutic way. Several folks have written about Alto’s Adventure as a meditative experience and a treatment for anxiety.\n\nJason Kottke <a href=\"https://kottke.org/16/06/update-to-altos-adventure-adds-endless-zen-mode\">likens the experience of playing Alto’s Adventure with mediation</a>.\n\n<br>\n<blockquote>I’ve played Alto’s Adventure a lot over the past year and a half. Like very a lot. At first, I played because the game was fun and I wanted to beat it. But eventually, I started playing the game when I was stressed or anxious. It became a form of meditation for me; playing cleared my mind and refocused my attention on the present. Even the seemingly stressful elements in the game became calming. The Elders, who spring up to give chase every few minutes, I don’t even notice anymore…which has become a metaphorical reminder for me to focus on my actions and what I can control and not worry about outside influences I can’t control.</blockquote>\nThe core of a meditative practice is directed focus on something. The most common object of focus is the breath. In <a href=\"https://www.mindful.org/a-five-minute-breathing-meditation/\">mindful breathing</a>, the mind is attuned to breathing, and when distractions inevitably arise, the mind is being trained to gently come back to the breath. In the <a href=\"http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/category/category/centering-prayer\">Christian tradition of Centering Prayer</a>, the practitioner learns to respond to distraction by mindfully bringing focus back to a sacred word. It is in these rituals that we can find a growing ability to let go of things that are not helpful and focus on the beauty and simplicity of the life that God has given to us.\n\nFor some, playing a game like Alto’s Adventure can be a calming substitute when meditation is difficult. Sameer Vasta <a href=\"https://www.inthemargins.ca/altos-adventure-anxiety\">writes about turning to the endless hills of Alto’s Adventure</a> when he’s too keyed up to meditate.\n\n<br>\n\n\n<blockquote>I’ve been fairly open about my struggles with anxiety and depression, but I haven’t shared that one of my favorite coping mechanisms for my anxiety (at least, when it isn’t very bad, but still needs intervention) is to play zen mode on Alto’s Adventure. The repetitive motion, the serene landscapes, and the soothing music is often just what I need to center myself and recapture my composure.</blockquote>\nThe stigma of adults playing videogames seems to have been relegated to the past. Still, when gaming, I find myself occasionally wondering whether completing arbitrary tasks to satisfy a computer program is the best use of my time. When you start to look at gaming as being a possible avenue to better emotional health, though, the calculus starts to change a bit. <b>Everyone</b> needs a counterweight to the heavy demands of life in our modern world. Framed that way, $4.99 and some time reserved for fun seems like a pretty good deal.\n",

Teach them researching, blogging, FTP. The challenge when you are in is to not become passive.

Some of their higher-profile hijinks are the stuff of legend. In those days, there were a few rock stars that were notorious for trashing hotel rooms. Van Halen took it to the next level and trashed the whole seventh floor of a hotel in Madison, Wisconsin.

But it’s interesting to note the ways in which audiences have become less tolerant, too. The rock and roll lifestyle, with its grams and groupies and all its messy grandeur, is no longer quite socially acceptable. Wanton destructiveness is no longer cool; the health and lifestyle choices of the rich and famous are fair game for criticism; and diva demands get you ripped apart on Twitter. All of this goes to show why superstars are more risk-averse today than they were in the ’70s and ’80s: They have to be. In the internet age, mockery is the national pastime and mistakes linger forever.</blockquote>\n\nI personally think the lack of tolerance for such behavior is mostly a good thing.

Though not terribly expensive, the monthly cost of the service has gone up recently (I got my email notification a couple of weeks ago). As Netflix works to develop more and more of their own content, their catalog of video for which they need to pay licensing fees has shrunk. Our family finds itself going back to buying DVD sets for those TV shows that, a couple of years ago, you could find on the market leading streaming video service.</p>\n\n<!-- /wp:core/paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core/paragraph {\"width\":\"center\"} -->\n\n<p class=\"aligncenter\">Then I watch a Netflix original series like <em>The Crown</em>. Though I’m a big fan of historical dramas, I didn’t know I needed a show about the modern day British royals until I watched <em>The Crown</em> on Netflix. The long span of the rule of Queen Elizabeth during some turbulent and transformative years means that the show has a lot of interesting material with which to work. As good as the subject matter is, though, the show wouldn’t be nearly as powerful as it is without the amazing performances from the principals.</p>\n\n<!-- /wp:core/paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core/paragraph {\"width\":\"center\"} -->\n\n<p class=\"aligncenter\">Claire Foy, who I had only previously seen play a pretty unlikeable Ann Boleyn in <em>Wolf Hall</em>, captures the reigning queen with both sympathy and vigor. Foy’s eyes could tell a series full of stories by themselves alone, and it’s in those eyes that viewers can find the uncanny ability to humanize a British monarch. If you weren’t an admirer of the queen before watching the show, you’ll find it hard to withhold admiration after you’re gone through the series. Foy’s Elizabeth comes across as a woman who has had enormous responsibilities that she never would have wished for thrust upon her. She struggles with an overpowering Prime Minister, feeling undereducated in the presence of other government officials, fears of infidelity, Christian forgiveness, family relationships gone sour and stinging personal criticism from journalists. Throughout it all, Elizabeth is vulnerable but resolute.</p>\n\n<!-- /wp:core/paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core/paragraph {\"width\":\"center\"} -->\n\n<p class=\"aligncenter\">Matt Smith is a great fit in the role of Prince Philip, Elizabeth’s husband and the Duke of Edinburgh. He plays the locker room, towel-snapping, man’s man aspect of Philip’s personality with aplomb. He’s also funny in a cynical kind of way and his steadiness even when you think he’s going to go astray makes him an endearing character.</p>\n\n<!-- /wp:core/paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core/paragraph {\"width\":\"center\"} -->\n\n<p class=\"aligncenter\">Vanessa Kirby is also a standout, chewing through the plush royal furniture as Princess Margaret with an intensity that suggests she knows she’s running out of time. It’s almost as if Kirby is trying to make her mark before <a href=\"https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/01/helena-bonham-carter-to-play-princess-margaret-on-the-crown/\">turning into Helena Bonham Carter</a> at the stroke of midnight.</p>\n\n<!-- /wp:core/paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core/paragraph {\"width\":\"center\"} -->\n\n<p class=\"aligncenter\">The twentieth century is an interesting time for the British monarchy. It’s made clear during the course of events depicted in the show that the royals have no official ability to influence the British government. Instead, the queen must use her powers of indirect influence to shape events in the kingdom. This is never more apparent or more satisfying than when a succession of prime ministers are summoned to meet with her. Some of my favorite moments from both the first and the second season of the show are when Elizabeth meets with John Lithgow as Winston Churchill, Jeremy Northam as Anthony Eden and Anton Lesser as Harold MacMillan. Her quiet but firm wisdom and the implied power of her crown have a certain effect on these ambitious men that’s humbling and instructive. It’s simply a joy to watch.</p>\n\n<!-- /wp:core/paragraph -->\n",

Given our understanding of the habit forming nature of social media apps, I guess it’s no surprise that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/the-end-of-the-social-era-twitter-facebook-snapchat\">one of the newer articles</a> to signal the death of social media starts out with a comparison to cocaine and heroin. Other articles that have been written recently about social media underscore the addictiveness. They have titles like <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vv5jkb/the-secret-ways-social-media-is-built-for-addiction\">Your Addiction to Social Media is No Accident</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/science/technology-addiction-irresistible-by-adam-alter.html\">Why We Can’t Look Away From Our Screens</a> and <a href=\"http://www.raptitude.com/2017/06/want-more-time-get-rid-of-the-easiest-way-to-spend-it/\">Want More Time? Get Rid of the Easiest Way to Spend It</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When I noticed one religiously Twitter-loving V.C. had become dormant on the platform, I e-mailed him to ask if he was O.K. His response: “Having a hard time imagining why I would come back [to Twitter]. Feels like an addictive, inflammatory disease that I have kicked, much to my immune system’s pleasure.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Not only are we frequently told of how easy it is to get hooked on social media, but we’re also told about how destructive a social media habit can be. Destructive to our relationships in real life. Detrimental to our ability to keep our minds open, as we’re bombarded with easy rewards for our confirmation bias. Harmful to our self-esteem, as we pour through posts from people that seem to be living better lives than our own. Eroding our sense of empathy, as we come to view others as pictures on a screen, rather than as whole people, made in the image of God.</p>\n<p>I recently found an entry in my journal, from five years ago, in which I contemplated joining Facebook. That never actually happened. Over the past year or so, I’ve thought about giving up other social media on a number of occasions. People I follow on various platforms (mostly Twitter) have taken breaks from time to time, tired of the toxicity of the discourse or just the time drain. Most of them have come back. They miss hot takes on current events, sharp and funny quips, and friends that can’t be found elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Quite often, using social media is presented as a binary choice. Either you do it, or you don’t. While used in excess, digital social platforms most definitely can present all of the problems described above, it is possible to strike a healthy balance. There is a third way that promotes connections between people where they live part of their lives (online) and does so in a healthy way. While I still wouldn’t recommend Facebook, mostly because of all of the data they collect about you and your contacts and the way they turn your life into their product, other social networks can be a more casual investment.</p>\n<p>When I was thinking about my ongoing relationship with social media, I found <a href=\"https://www.challies.com/podcast/the-art-of-godliness-episode-10-social-media/\">this podcast</a> from Paul Martin and Tim Challies to be very helpful. Challies does a good job putting some of the alarming statistics in perspective. He outlines some of the types of interactions that should go on through social media (keeping touch with those that are distant) and some (such as conflict) that definitely should not take place in that forum. Challies advocates staying away from people who are obviously not people of character online and reminds that you don’t need to engage with those who disagree with you.</p>\n<p>There are ways you can balance your social media usage so that it ends up being a net positive. If you find yourself constantly checking social media, you can be mindful of that. You can learn how to break the twitch. A simple way to start might be to  avoid making checking social media first thing in the morning or late at night. Recognize that what other people post online is a <em>version</em> of themselves and don’t get trapped into believing that others are living their best life and you are not. Those <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/BcxatDpHchy/\">van life posts</a> on Instagram are carefully staged to represent an idyllic moment. Don’t stoke or feed into conflict online. If you have people attacking you for things you've said, consider making your profile private.</p>\n<p>Twitter, Instagram and other social networks can bring us closer together. They can help us keep up with family and make good friends in distant places. In moderation, they can help us keep up with the news. They can introduce us to the beautiful creations of others. We just need to be careful of the ways in which social media can be abused and end up being a negative influence. My hope is that we can all learn to use social media without it owning us.</p>  \n<br>\nPhoto by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/4l-e7U6c5ek?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Warren Wong</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a>\n",
